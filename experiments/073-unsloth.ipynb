      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mr. Boddy was in the Library at 11:30 PM and the suspect motivated by Power was in the Library at that time, the Library cannot be the location of the murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The murderer was in the Library at 11:30 PM, so the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Library at 11:30 PM. Further, the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Hall to the Lounge at 11:30 PM, so the Power motive had to be in the Lounge at 10:30 PM, and then moved to the Hall at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Wrench was in the Ballroom at 12:30 AM, the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Ballroom at 12:30 AM. Further, this means the Jealousy motive had to be in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM and in the Ballroom at 10:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Lead Pipe was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM and was in the Gazebo at 01:00 AM, the Lead Pipe must have been in the Gazebo at 01:00 AM. And, since the Lead Pipe was originally in the same room as the Wrench, the Wrench was in the Gazebo at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Wrench was in the WOC room at 10:00 PM, it was in room W (01, 02, 03 or 04).\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Wrench was in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM and was moved from the WOC room to the Gazebo at 11:00 PM, the person who moved the Wrench must have done so at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Ambition moved from the Gazebo to the Ballroom at 12:00 AM. Since this person had to move from the WOC room to the Gazebo at 11:00 PM, the person had to be in the Ballroom at 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM. Since the Ballroom was empty before 10:30 PM, the WOC room is 03.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the suspect motivated by Power was in the Hall at 10:30 PM, the Hall is not the N or S room of 03 (as the Power would have had to stay in the Hall when he moved from the Cloak Room to the Hall).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the other three rooms not yet ruled out are W (03), W (02), and N (04). To place the suspects, consider the contradiction that would occur if each of them was in those rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider Mr. Boddy moving from the Courtyard to the Library at 11:00 PM (and all other suspects staying in 03 W, 02 W, or 04 N). Then Mr. Boddy would have been in 04 N at 11:00 PM and 03 W or 02 W at 11:30 PM. If Mr. Boddy was in the Drawing Room or the Hall, he could not have been in the Library at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assume Mr. Boddy was in the room W (02) at 11:00 PM and in the room W (03) at 11:30 PM. Since Professor Plum was in the room E of Mr. Boddy at 11:00 PM and in the room E of the suspect motivated by Pride at 11:00 PM, Professor Plum was in the room N of the suspect motivated by Pride at 11:00 PM. This means Professor Plum was in the Hall at 10:30 PM, but he could not have been in the Hall at 10:30 PM as the suspect motivated by Pride was in the Hall then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the case that the Hall is W (02). With this, Professor Plum could not be in the Hall at 11:00 PM, meaning he was in the room N of the suspect motivated by Pride at 11:00 PM, which is the room W (03). Since the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Library at 11:30 PM, Professor Plum moved to the Drawing Room at 11:00 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Cloak Room to the Hall at 12:30 AM, if the Hall was W (02), then Power could be in one of S (02), N (02), W (02), or E (02).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Power was in the Hall at 10:30 PM, he was in the Hall that is W (02) since he could not be in the Hall that is S (02), N (02), or E (02).\n",

      "\n",
      "Since the Power was in the Hall at 10:30 PM, he was in the Hall that is W (04) since he could not be in the Hall that is S (04), N (04), or E (04).\n",

      "\n",
      "Consider that the Hall is N (04). This would place Monsieur Brunette in the room W (04) at 11:30 PM, which would put him in the same room as the suspect motivated by Anger at 11:30 PM, who had to be Mrs. White.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Sgt. Gray was in the room W of Monsieur Brunette at 10:00 PM, Sgt. Gray was in the room N of the suspect motivated by Power at 10:00 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Sgt. Gray was in the room E of the suspect motivated by Power at 10:00 PM, Sgt. Gray was in the room E of the room N of the Hall at 10:00 PM.\n",

      "\n",
      "If the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Library at 11:30 PM, Sgt. Gray was in the room N of the Library at 11:30 PM and moved to the room W of Monsieur Brunette at 12:00 AM.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here is the reasoning and the explanation for each step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Hall at 11:30 PM**: From the clue \"Madame Rose was in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM or the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Hall at 11:30 PM\", we can narrow down the location of the suspect motivated by Revenge to the Hall at 11:30 PM. **(11:30 PM)**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mrs. White is motivated by Betrayal**: It is given in the clues that Mrs. White is motivated by Betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The suspect motivated by Fear was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM**: Since \"The suspect motivated by Fear was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM if and only if the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM\", the suspect motivated by Jealousy must be in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM. Since \"The suspect motivated by Fear was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM if and only if the Wrench was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM\", and the Wrench is in the Lounge at some point, the suspect motivated by Fear must be in the Lounge at 12:00 AM. **(12:00 AM)**\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM**: Since \"The suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM\", Mrs. White must be in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Sgt. Gray was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM**: Since \"Sgt. Gray was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM if and only if Madame Rose was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM\", and Madame Rose is in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM, Sgt. Gray must be in the Lounge at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Sgt. Gray and the Wrench were in the Lounge together at least once**: Since Sgt. Gray is in the Lounge at 11:30 PM, the Wrench must be in the Lounge at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Sgt. Gray was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM**: Since \"Mr. Boddy was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM or Sgt. Gray was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM\", Sgt. Gray must be in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Mr. Green was in the Library at 11:30 PM or the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM**: Since \"Mr. Boddy was in the Library at 11:30 PM or the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM\", the suspect motivated by Greed must be in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Monsieur Brunette was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM or the suspect motivated by Power was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM**: Since \"Monsieur Brunette was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM or the suspect motivated by Power was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM\", the suspect motivated by Power was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **The Lead Pipe and the Candlestick were in the Kitchen together at least once**: Since the Lead Pipe and the Candlestick were in the Kitchen together at least once, the suspect motivated by Hatred must be in the Kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **The suspect motivated by Ambition moved from the Study to the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM**: Since \"The suspect motivated by Ambition moved from the Study to the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM\", Mr. Boddy must be in the Study at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **The suspense murder**: The location of the murder weapon and the murderer must be considered one by one. There are five suspects remaining: Colonel Mustard, Colonel Mustard was in the Study at 11:30 PM. **(11:30 PM)**\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **The suspects were not in the Hall at 12:00 AM**: Since \"The Poison was in the Hall at 12:00 AM\", the murderer must not be in the Hall at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. **The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM**: Since the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM, \"The Lead Pipe and the Candlestick were in the Kitchen together at least once\", and \"Mrs. White was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM\" with Mrs. White in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Hatred must be in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. **Colonel Mustard moved from the Carriage House to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM**: Since the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Kitchen at some point, and the movement from the Carriage House to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM could only have been Colonel Mustard, the suspect motivated by Hatred was indeed Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. **Monsieur Brunette was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM if and only if the Rope was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM**: Since \"Monsieur Brunette was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM if and only if the Rope was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM\", the Rope must be in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. **Monsieur Brunette was in the Kitchen at 11:30 PM or the suspect motivated by Power was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM**: Since \"Monsieur Brunette was in the Kitchen at 11:30 PM or the suspect motivated by Power was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM\", the suspect motivated by Power was indeed in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. **The suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Cloak Room at 11:30 PM**: Since \"The suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Cloak Room at 11:30 PM if and only if the murder weapon was in the Study at 12:00 AM\", the murder weapon must be in the Study at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. **The murderous suspect**: Given that the murder occurred in the Study at 12:00 AM, and the murder weapon was in the Study at 12:00 AM, the suspect must be either Mrs. White, who is motivated by Betrayal, Madame Rose, who was in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM, Professor Plum, who was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM, or someone else. Since Madame Rose and the Wrench were in the Lounge together at least once, Madame Rose was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. **Colonel Mustard was in the Study at 11:30 PM**: Since \"Colonel Mustard moved from the Carriage House to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM\", Colonel Mustard must have been in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. **The murderer**: Since \"The suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the same room as Miss Scarlet at 12:00 AM\" and \"Miss Scarlet was in the Hall at 11:30 PM\", Miss Scarlet and the murderer must be in the same room at 11:30 PM. Since the murderer must be in the Study with the murder weapon at 11:30 PM but wasn't Sgt. Gray and wasn't the suspect motivated by Hatred, the murderer is not the suspect motivated by Ambition and not the suspect motivated by Revenge. Since \"The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Kitchen at some point and **(Carriage House)**\", \"The suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Hall at 11:30 PM\", the murderer must not be the suspects motivated by Hatred, Revenge, Betrayal. The suspect motivated by Jealousy must be in the Hall at 11:30 PM with Miss Scarlet, the murderer must be in the Study at 11:30 PM, and the murderer must not be the suspect motivated by Jealousy.\n",

      "22. **The only left suspect**: Since the murderer was in the Study at 11:30 PM, Mrs. White was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM, Madame Rose was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM, Professor Plum was in the Cloak Room at 11:30 PM, and the murderer was not Sgt.

The murder weapon thus cannot be the Wrench. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since a Power-seeker is in the same room as Mr Boddy, and Mrs. White is in the Hall, we conclude Mrs. White and the Wrench cannot be in the Courtyard. \n",

      "The Knife is just east of Miss Scarlet, and since Monsieur Brunette is west of the Knife, the Knife must be in room 2. Colonel Mustard cannot be in room 2 because Monsieur Brunette is in the room west of the Knife, meaning the Knife must be in room 2, thus Monsieur Brunette is in room 1, which would place the Lead Pipe in room 6. \n",

      "The Wrench, therefore, is in the room where the Lead Pipe is, which is the Hall. The Lead Pipe is in room 5, which means that Mr. Boddy is in room 6. Since there is only one Power-seeker, Mrs. White, it means the Power-seeker (Mrs. White) must be in room 4 to be alone with the Wrench, while the room east of room 4 must be the Courtyard (where Mr. Boddy was found) so the Lead Pipe is there too, in room 6. Mr. Boddy must be in room 5 so the Lead Pipe isn't in the Courtyard, thus killing the Lead Pipe possibility (if it were in 5 or 6, we would have the sentence: Mr. Boddy murder in Courtyard). Mrs. White can't be in room 5 because then the Power-seeker would be on the same east-west line as the Courtyard (the room must be in the \"lower\" part of the map), thus Mr. Boddy must be in room 4. This means the Power-seeker must be in room 6. \n",

      "Colonel Mustard is now a suspect because he has been placed on the same row as room 5 and we know the Knife must be in room 2 so he isn't in room 2. The only possible scenario left for him is the room directly above room 5 (room 6), except Mrs. White must be there (the power-seeker), so that leaves him in the room above room 4 where the Wrench isn't (because it's in room 5), which must then be room 3. Therefore, Colonel Mustard must be in room 3.\n",

      "\n",
      "Since we deduce Colonel Mustard's room to be 3 (same line as room 5) and he can't be in room 2 (as the Knife is in room 2), he must be in the room where the Lead Pipe and Wrench aren't, which would be the room above the Courtyard, thus making room 3 his possible location.\n",

      "We also deduce that Colonel Mustard must use the Lead Pipe as the murder weapon because it's the only logical option left, and he must kill in the Courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsieur Brunette must be above the room with the Knife (2), so he must be in room 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find that Mr. Green can't be in room 1 or 2 because Monsieur Brunette is in room 1. The only option for the only person left who wasn't mentioned is room 4, however we can eliminate this option because then Mr. Boddy would be in room 5 and the Lead Pipe wouldn't be in room 5, we can also eliminate room 6 because then Power-seeker Mrs. White would be able to be the room above the Courtyard; both of these eliminate two more options so only one is left: room 3 (since that's where Mr. Boddy cannot be in, so it must be the other room of its row, and Mr. Boddy is either in 4 or 5 or 6 as deduced earlier, making the only choice to be in room 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Deduction E and all other remaining deductions determine he must be in room 3 as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, Mr Green must be in room 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsieur Brunette is motivated by Ambition, Monsieur Brunette was in room 1 and we have concluded that Monsieur Brunette was in the room just west of the knife, thus Monsieur Brunette must be motivated by Ambition, which therefore must be (E) in room 1.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The Horseshoe was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM if and only if Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM. As the Horseshoe is in the Lounge at 11:30 PM if and only if the Revolver was present in the Lounge and Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen, and the Revolver was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM if and only if Miss Peach was in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM. Since the Revolver was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM and the Horseshoe was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM, we know that Mrs. Peacock must have been in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM and the Poison must have been in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM, which, by the Poison in the Carriage House condition, means Lead Pipe was already in the Study at 11:30 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Since Miss Peach was in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM, the Revolver must have been in the Lounge at 12:00 AM and the Horseshoe in the Lounge at 11:30 PM. So the Horseshoe is the Horseshoe weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Miss Peach was in the same room as the Poison at 11:00 PM, and the Poison was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Study at 12:00 AM. So a suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM, and a suspect motivated by Pride moved from the Gazebo to the Study at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. A suspect motivated by Pride moved the Knife from the Carriage House to the Kitchen at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Since Colonel Mustard was in the room just east of Mr. Green at 11:00 PM and the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Study at 12:00 AM, Colonel Mustard and Mr. Green must be next to each other at 11:00 PM. As Miss Peach was in the room just east of the Poison at 11:00 PM, Colonel Mustard and Mr. Green were in the Gazebo and the Kitchen, respectively. Sgt. Gray and Colonel Mustard were in the Gazebo together at least once, meaning Mr. Green was in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. A suspect motivated by Betrayal moved from the Trophy Room to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM and Mrs. White was in the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM. The suspect motivated by Greed was in the Trophy Room at 11:00 PM if and only if a suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM. So Mrs. White was in the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM and a suspect motivated by Greed was in the Trophy Room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room at 11:00 PM and Miss Peach moved from the Kitchen to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. The Lead Pipe was in the same room as the Wrench at 11:00 PM, which was in the Study, and the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Study at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The murderer was in the Lounge at 11:00 PM if and only if the Horseshoe was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM and a suspect motivated by Pride moved the Poison from the Carriage House to the Study then to the Lounge, which means the murderer was in the Lounge at 11:00 PM, which was the case of Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the murderer is Colonel Mustard, the weapon was the Horseshoe, the room was the Lounge, the time was 11:00 PM and the motive was Betrayal. Mrs. Peacock moved from the Kitchen, the Revolver was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM and the Horseshoe was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM. The Poison was in the Carriage House at 11:00 PM.\n",

      "E. Ambition\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the step-by-step reasoning behind the answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. From the clue \"The Knife was in the Study at 11:45 PM or Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM,\" either the Knife in the Study at 11:45 PM was moved from the Study at 11:45 PM, in which case Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room, or Mr. Boddy was in the Study at 11:45 PM. Since we know Mr. Boddy was the victim, the first case is impossible. Thus, the other case must be true.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"A suspect motivated by Greed was in the Courtyard at 12:15 AM if and only if a suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Kitchen at 12:15 AM\" gives us two new clues:\n",
      "   * Let's assume the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Courtyard at 12:15 AM. This can only be true if the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Kitchen at 12:15 AM.\n",
      "   * If the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Kitchen at 12:15 AM, then the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Courtyard at 12:15 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"A suspect motivated by Greed was in the Courtyard at 12:15 AM if and only if a suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Kitchen at 12:15 AM\" can be rewritten as either \"A suspect motivated by Greed was in the Courtyard at 12:15 AM and a suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Kitchen at 12:15 AM\" or \"No suspect was in the Courtyard at 12:15 AM and no suspect was in the Kitchen at 12:15 AM.\" In any case, if we choose a suspect to be motivated by Greed, they are in the Courtyard, and if we choose a suspect to be motivated by Ambition, they are in the Kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. From the clue \"The Knife was in the Library at 12:15 AM or the Wrench was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM,\" we see that the Wrench cannot be in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM, because a suspect motivated by Power would have already moved from the Library to the Fountain by 12:00 AM. Since \"A suspect motivated by Power moved from the Library to the Fountain at 12:00 AM,\" the Wrench cannot be in the Library at the specific time, as this would have prevented the Power suspect from moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The clue \"Miss Peach and Monsieur Brunette were in the Trophy Room together at least once\" cannot be used to determine who the two individuals are. However, considering it with \"The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM\" tells us that if at least one of Miss Peach or Monsieur Brunette was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM, the other is in the same room, and the Hatred suspect is also there, then the Hatred suspect must be one of the one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. \"The suspect motivated by Fear was in the same room as the Candlestick at 12:00 AM\" and \"The Candlestick was in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM or Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM\" imply that either the Candlestick was in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM and the suspect motivated by Fear was there, or Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM. In either case, the suspect motivated by Fear was in the same room as the Candlestick at 12:00 AM, which means that one of the possibilities for the Candlestick's placement at 11:45 PM must be the Dining Room.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Since the Candlestick was in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM, then at 11:45 PM it was either in the room just north of the Dining Room (which is 04) or the room just south of the Dining Room (which is 01). If the Candlestick was in the room just south of the Dining Room at 11:45 PM, then Mr. Boddy must have been in the Study at 11:45 PM, because \"The Knife was in the Study at 11:45 PM or Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM,\" so \"The Candlestick was in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM or Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM.\" This case is impossible, as the suspect motivated by Fear cannot be in the Dining Room at 11:45 PM since \"The Candlestick was in the room just north of Sgt. Gray at 12:00 AM.\" Thus, the Candlestick is in the room just north of the Dining Room at 11:45 PM. \"The Revolver was in the same room as Sgt. Gray at 11:45 PM\" means the room just south of the Dining Room at 12:00 AM is either the room just south of the room just north of the Dining Room at 11:45 PM or Sgt. Gray's room.\n",

This is a contradiction because \"Mrs. White was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM or the Knife was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM,\" which means Mrs. White must be in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM.

If Mrs. White were in the courtyard, then Mrs. White could only be the suspect motivated by Anger who moved from the Gazebo to the Hall at 12:00 AM. This solution contradicts \"The Knife was in the Studio at 11:45 PM or Mr. Green was in the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM\" since \"The suspect motivated by Anger moved from the Gazebo to the Hall at 12:00 AM\" because then the suspect motivated by Anger were in the Gazebo and the courtyard at 12:00, which means Mrs. White must be the suspect motivated by Anger.\n",

Since we already determined this isn't possible, this solution must be false.\n",

      "The key to solving this mystery is understanding the movements and interactions of the suspects and their motives. Let's break down the events:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lead Pipe was in the Hall at 01:00 AM, and the murderer moved it from there at some point. The Lead Pipe cannot be the murder weapon at 01:00 AM, so it must have arrived at the Hall before 01:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 09:00 PM, the Lead Pipe was in the Studio. At 09:00 PM, the Wrench was in the Drawing Room, but the Wrench was in the Hall at 08:00 PM if the murder weapon was in the Study at 10:00 PM. This implies that the Wrench must have moved from the Hall to the Drawing Room between 08:00 PM and 09:00 PM, which means the Lead Pipe is initially in the Hall. Therefore, the Lead Pipe moved from the Hall to the Studio at some point, likely at 09:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this movement, the Lead Pipe was in the Studio at 09:00 PM, and Mrs. White was at the fountain at 09:00 PM if and only if the Wrench was in the Drawing Room at 09:00 PM, implying that the Wrench was moved to the Drawing Room at 09:00 PM (as deduced earlier). However, Mrs. White moved from the Drawing Room to the Carriage House at 09:00 PM, making the condition \"Mrs. White was at the fountain at 09:00 PM\" false. Therefore, Mrs. White must be in the Carriage House at 09:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 11:00 PM, the murderer was in the Trophy Room, and the murder could have only occurred if the suspect motivated by Power was in the Lounge at 02:00 AM. If the suspect motivated by Ambition moved the Lead Pipe from the Studio to the Hall at 12:00 AM, then the Wrench was in the Hall at 11:00 PM. Given that the Lead Pipe was in the Hall at 11:00 PM, it could not be the murder weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, at 11:00 PM, the murder did not occur, but the suspect motivated by Power was not in the Lounge at 02:00 AM, then the suspect motivated by Power must have made the move from the Hall to the Studio. The suspect motivated by Power must have moved the Knife from the Trophy Room to the Fountain at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 09:00 PM, the murderer was not in the Hall; the murderer moved the Lead Pipe from the Hall to the Studio and the Wrench to the Drawing Room. The Lead Pipe must be the murder weapon, so at 09:00 PM, the murderer was already in the Hall, making the statement \"Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room at 08:00 PM\" consistent. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Wrench was in the Hall, both at 09:00 PM and at 08:00 PM. If the Wrench was in the Hall at 08:00 PM, then the murder weapon was in the Study at 10:00 PM. However, the Lead Pipe was in the Studio at 08:00 PM, so this contradiction is impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, the Wrench was not in the Hall at 08:00 PM. Given that the Lead Pipe and the Wrench were in the Hall together at least once, the Lead Pipe cannot be the murder weapon at 09:00 PM, implying the Wrench was the murder weapon. \n",
      "\n",
      "This explanation leads to several deductions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Wrench was the murder weapon.\n",
      "2. The Wrench was in the Hall at 09:00 PM (implying the Lead Pipe was initially in the Hall).\n",
      "3. At 09:00 PM, the murderer was in the Hall.\n",
      "4. At 10:00 PM, the Wrench was in the Hall so the Lead Pipe was in the Studio (as the Wrench was in the Hall at 09:00 PM, making the condition \"Wrench was in the Hall at 08:00 PM if and only if the Lead Pipe was in the Study at 10:00 PM\" valid).\n",
      "\n",
      "At 10:00 PM, the Wrench was in the Hall. However, if the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Studio, then the Lead Pipe was in the Hall at 10:00 PM, which is a contradiction. This implies the suspect motivated by Ambition was not in the Studio at 10:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, at 10:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Power was at the Fountain at 10:00 PM. Therefore, the murder weapon was the Lead Pipe at 10:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the given clues, it follows that at 08:00 PM, the Lead Pipe was in the Studio, and the Wrench was in the Hall. It also follows that at 09:00 PM, Mrs. White was in the Carriage House, and the Wrench was in the Drawing Room. \n",
      "\n",
      "At 10:00 PM, the Wrench was in the Hall, and the Lead Pipe was in the Studio or the Hall (The Lead Pipe was in the Studio initially and moved to the Hall at 09:00 PM. The Lead Pipe must have moved back to the Studio or stayed in the Hall at 10:00 PM. If it moved to the Studio, then the Lead Pipe was in the Studio, and the Wrench was in the Hall. But then the Lead Pipe would be in the Hall at 10:00 PM, because at 09:00 PM, it was in the Hall first and moved to the Studio, but the Lead Pipe cannot be in the Hall at 10:00 PM, or this would make the Lead Pipe and the Wrench in the Hall at the same time at 09:00 PM. Thus, the Lead Pipe stayed in the Studio at 10:00 PM. If the Lead Pipe was in the Studio, it cannot be the Wrench because the Wrench was in the Hall at 10:00 PM. This implies the Lead Pipe is not in the Studio and must be in the Hall, which is impossible, therefore moving the Lead Pipe to the Hall at 10:00 PM was incorrect. This was an error. This situation cannot occur. Thus the correct Lead Pipe position at 10:00 PM is either in the Studio or the Hall. If at 10:00 PM, it was in the Hall, Madame Rose would have been in the room just east of the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM, but Madame Rose moved from the room just east of the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM, then she could only have moved there from the Hall at 10:00 PM), and the Lead Pipe was in the room just west of the Lead Pipe. This situation cannot occur. The Lead Pipe was in the room to the west of the Lead Pipe at 10:00 PM, which is impossible. The Lead Pipe must have been in the Hall, and the Wrench was in the Studio at 10:00 PM).\n",
      "\n",
      "At 9:00 PM, the Lead Pipe and the Wrench must be in the Hall and the Studio respectively, making the statement \"The Lead Pipe was in the room just east of the Knife\" consistent with the Lead Pipe being in the Hall, but the Wrench was in the Studio at 09:00 PM, so the Lead Pipe is in the Hall. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Wrench was in the House at some point. The suspect motivated by Power must be the suspect who was at the Fountain at 11:00 PM. Madame Rose and Sgt. Gray were together at 10:00 PM, so Sgt. Gray was not the one motivated by Power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sgt. Gray was in the room with Mrs. White at least once. Mrs. White was at the Carriage House at 09:00 PM. Mrs. White was in the room with Sgt. Gray at least once. There are three possibilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Mrs. White was in the Carriage House, and Sgt. Gray was in the Courtyard.\n",
      "*   Mrs. White was in the Courtyard, and Sgt. Gray was in the Carriage House.\n",
      "*   Both in the same room.\n",

      "Here's the explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Since Madame Rose was not in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM, and the murderer must have been, then Madame Rose cannot be the murderer.\n",
      "- Mr. Boddy was in the Study at 11:45 PM and the murderer must have been in the Carriage House, so the murderer could not be in the same room as Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "- The murderer was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM. At 12:00 AM, they could have been in one of the rooms adjacent to the Carriage House, which includes the Library.\n",
      "- If the murderer was in the Study at 12:00 AM, then the Lead Pipe would be in the Carriage House, which contradicts another clue that the Lead Pipe was in the room just west of Monsieur Brunette at 11:45 PM and thus the murderer could not be in the Study at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- If the murderer was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, then the lead pipe would be in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM, which again contradicts another clue that the Lead Pipe was in the room just west of Monsieur Brunette at 11:45 PM, so the murderer was not in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- Since the Lead Pipe was in the room just west of Monsieur Brunette at 11:45 PM, then Monsieur Brunette cannot be in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- If the murderer was in the Library at 12:00 AM, then the Lead Pipe would be in the room where Monsieur Brunette was at 11:45 PM, which contradicts the fact that the hare Pipe was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM, so the murderer was not in the Library at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- Since the Lead Pipe was in the room just west of the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM, the Lead Pipe must be in the Study, which means the murderer was in the Billiard Room.\n",
      "- Since the Candlestick was in the same room as the Lead Pipe at 12:00 AM, then the Candlestick must be in the Study at 12:00 AM and the murderer was in the room with the Candlestick and the Lead Pipe at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Since the murderer was in the Study at 11:45 PM and the Lead Pipe was in the Study at 12:00 AM, the murderer could not be in the Study at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- From the clue about Professor Plum and Miss Peach, we can determine that the pair moved to the room adjacent to the Study (which is the Billiard Room) at 11:45 PM. \n",
      "- Therefore, the murderer must be in the room where the pair moved to at 11:45 PM but was not at 11:45 PM. Since they moved to the room adjacent to the Study at 11:45 PM, the pair must have been in the Room above the Study at 11:45 PM, so the murderer couldn't have been there and the pair moved to the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- The Billiard Room is next to the Library and the Library is next to the Carriage House adjacent to the room opposite to the Study, the Carriage House must be adjacent to the room opposite to the Billiard Room, proving that the murder occurred in the Carriage House adjacent to the Billiard Room is the only one that is possible.\n",
      "Given that John Q. Boddy must have been in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM for the murderer in the Billiard Room, Madame Rose must be in the Billiard room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "Since the killer was in the Billiard Room and the Carriage House is next to the Billiard Room in the north-south direction. So the Lead Pipe was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM \n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Professor Plum was in the same row as Sgt. Gray, so Professor Plum must be in the same column as Sgt. Gray. The only columns with Sgt. Gray present are the 1st and 3rd column. Since the Knife and Rope are also in the 3rd column, the 3rd column must be the correct column.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Sgt. Gray in the 3rd column and Professor Plum in the same column as Sgt. Gray, Professor Plum must also be in the 3rd column. Furthermore, Sgt. Gray is motivated by Ambition. Professor Plum cannot be motivated by Greed because Mrs. White is already motivated by Greed. Since a couple of motives overlap with Professor Plum's column and Professor Plum can't have the Horseshoe as the murder weapon due to the Candlestick already being associated with that weapon, Professor Plum must be motivated by Revenge. \n",
      "\n",
      "Professor Plum being motivated by Revenge means the Revolver must be in the Dining Room. This was also possible for other suspects, but the unique information of Professor Plum would make this work. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given Professor Plum is in the 3rd column and Professor Plum being motivated by Revenge allows us to further narrow down the possible victims of the other motives. \n",
      "\n",
      "B. The Hall was already a required solution earlier and does not conflict with any other information, so we can rely on the Hall as the solution for the murder location. \n",
      "\n",
      "C. Professor Plum being motivated by Revenge backs up the solution because the Revolver is in the same room as Professor Plum, and it was in the Dining Room. Since the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Dining Room when the Revolver was in the Study, we know the Revolver was actually in the Dining Room.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. Starting from where Professor Plum is, the library must be two spaces to the left, which is the same location as the Rope. Alternatively, it was possible to determine the solution from Professor Plum or another statement. \n",
      "\n",
      "E. Based on the established Horseshoe location in the Dining Room, a suspect motivated by Greed cannot be in the Dining Room, but Madame Rose being in the Carriage House means the Horseshoe must be in the Trophy Room, then Madame Rose must be in the Carriage House.\n",

      "- The Horseshoe was in the same room as Sgt. Gray at 11:45 PM. Sgt. Gray was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM (Clue 3), so Sgt. Gray was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 11:45 PM. However, the Horseshoe was in the Courtyard at 11:45 PM (Clue 15), which means Sgt. Gray was in the Courtyard at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- According to Clue 15, the Wrench was in the Courtyard at 11:45 PM. Also, the Wrench was moved by a suspect with a motive of greed (we can deduce this later on).\n",
      "- Since Sgt. Gray was in the Courtyard at 11:45 PM, we can conclude that the Lead Pipe, the Rope, and the Wrench were not in the room with Sgt. Gray at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Study at 11:45 PM, but the Candlestick was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM if and only if Sgt. Gray was in the Study at 11:45 PM (Clue 29). Therefore, Sgt. Gray was in the Study at 11:45 PM, but the motive can not be confirmed, so we continue.\n",
      "- Madame Rose was in the room just north of Mrs. White at 12:00 AM, but Mrs. White was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM or Miss Scarlet was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM (Clue 7). Since Mrs. White cannot be in two places at the same time, Mrs. White was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM and Miss Scarlet was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Mr. Green moved from the Carriage House to the Studio at 12:00 AM (Clue 31). If the murderer was at the Fountain at 12:00 AM, then Mr. Boddy's body must have been there earlier. Mr. Boddy must have been in the Hall at 11:45 PM (otherwise, the murderer and Mr. Boddy would have been in the same room at 12:00 AM which is not a valid scenario since the killer was in the Hall at 12:00 AM). Since the murderer and Mr. Boddy were at the Fountain at least once (Clue 24), they must have been at the Fountain at 11:45 PM as well, given that Mr. Boddy was already dead. Therefore, the murderer was in the Hall at 12:00 AM. \n",
      "- Given that the victim was at the Hall at 11:45 PM, the Hall was the only valid location for the murder - and a suspect with a motive of Hatred was in the Hall at 11:45 PM, and given the statements above, the murderer was in the Hall at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- If Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 11:45 PM the killer was in the Hall at 12:00 AM, then Sgt. Gray was in the Study at 11:45 PM (the Candlestick was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM if Sgt. Gray was in the Study at 11:45 PM) but she is already in the Courtyard at 11:45 PM and thus she cannot be in the Study at 11:45 PM. \n",

      "- The Horseshoe was in the Courtyard at 11:45 PM (Clue 15), so this eliminates the possibility that Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- Mrs. Peacock was in the same room as Monsieur Brunette at 11:45 PM, 12:00 AM (Clue 22) or Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM. The Wrench was in the Courtyard at 11:45 PM so Mrs. Peacock was in the same room as Monsieur Brunette at 11:45 PM and at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "-  Mrs. White was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM and a suspect motivated by Fear was in the same room as Miss Scarlet at 11:45 PM and Miss Scarlet was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM, so we can conclude that the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM. Mrs. Peacock can not be in the same room as the suspect motivated by Fear, since she was in the same room as Monsieur Brunette at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- Mrs. White was in the Ballroom and also a suspect motivated by Fear (Mrs. White) was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM. \n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Hall at 11:45 PM if and only if a suspect motivated by Greed was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM (Clue 23). Both conditions must be true since a suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Hall at 11:45 PM and the murderer was also in the Hall at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Professor Plum was in the same room as Mrs. White at 12:00 AM (Clue 1), so Mrs. White was not in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM, and thus Mrs. White was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM. \n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Greed was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM or Professor Plum was in the Studio at 12:00 AM (Clue 26). Since Professor Plum was in the Studio at 12:00 AM (Clue 21), a suspect motivated by Greed was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM. \n",
      " Given the statements above, the suspect with a motive of Greed was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM, which led to the Carriage house room having Mrs. Peacock and Sgt. Gray. Colonel Mustard moved from the Billiard Room to the Hall at 12:00 AM (Clue 8), which means that Sgt. Gray cannot have moved from the Hall to the Lounge, since he must be at the Hall or Billiard at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Greed moved the Wrench (Clue 15), so the Wrench is the weapon of choice.\n",
      "- Mrs. Peacock cannot be in the Fountain at 12:00 AM or 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Hall at 11:45 PM if and only if a suspect with Greed was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM. A suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Hall at 11:45 PM, so a suspect motivated by Greed was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM (Clue 23). The Lead Pipe must have been in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM, since the murderer and Mr. Boddy were alone in a room with at least one weapon at some point in the night, and the murderer was not yet murdered.\n",
      "- The Lead Pipe and the Poison were in the Trophy Room together at least once (Clue 6), but the Poison was not in the Ballroom as the Love Pipe was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM. The suspect with the motive of Greed was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM, but the Carriage House and the Trophy Room are not adjacent to each other, so the distance between them must be at least two rooms. \n",
      "- The lead Pipe was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM, which was the room the suspect with the motive of Greed was not in at 11:45 PM. The murderer was in the Hall at 12:00 AM and the lead Pipe was in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM, so the Lead Pipe cannot be in the Hall at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- Colonel Mustard was not in the Hall at 12:00 AM but was in the Billiard room at 11:45 PM (the dance explains this below), yet he moved to the Hall at 12:00 AM. Mrs. Peacock was not in the same room as Colonel Mustard during the night.\n",
      "- Given that the Lead Pipe was in the room with Mr. Boddy and the murderer, which must have been the Hall at 11:45 PM, Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 11:45 PM (either in the Hall or Carriage House at 11:45 PM).\n",

      "Given that the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the same room as the Revolver at 08:00 PM and Madame Rose was in the room just north of the Revolver at 11:00 PM, Madame Rose is the suspect motivated by Betrayal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Colonel Mustard was in the Hall at 07:00 PM or the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Lounge at 07:00 PM, Colonel Mustard was in the Hall at 07:00 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Colonel Mustard moved from the Hall to the Gazebo at 10:00 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the room just west of Colonel Mustard at 10:00 PM, Mrs. Peacock was in the Gazebo at 10:00 PM. Also, Mr. Green was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 11:00 PM. \n",

      "Since the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Gazebo at 08:00 PM, this Ambition suspect and Agriculture suspect cannot be the same person since the Agriculture suspect moved from the Gazebo to the Hall at 01:00 AM. \n",

      "Since Sir Gray was in the Trophy Room at 08:00 PM, it eliminates Madame Rose as the Ambition suspect since Madame Rose was in the room just east of the Horseshoe at 07:00 PM. \n",

      "Since Madame Rose was in the room just north of the Horseshoe at 07:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Love is not the same person as the suspect who moved the Lead Pipe from the Ballroom to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM. However, the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Ballroom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mr. Green was in the room just south of Madame Rose at 06:00 PM, Mr. Green was in the same room as the suspect motivated by Love at 06:00 PM, so they were in the Ballroom.\n",

      "Therefore, the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Hall at 10:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Love was in the Ballroom at 06:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Trophy Room at 07:00 PM, Madame Rose was in the Hall at 08:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM. \n",

      "1.  The suspect motivated by Ambition moved the Revolver from the Conservatory to the Carriage House at 12:15 AM, but the Revolver and the Candlestick were in the same room at 11:45 PM. This means that the suspect motivated by Ambition was at the Carriage House and the Conservatory at 11:45 PM.\n",

      "2.  The Revolver was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, and the Revolver was in the Carriage House at 12:30 AM, so Sgt. Gray was in the Lounge at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Mrs. Peacock was in the room just east of the Rope at 11:30 PM, so Mr. Boddy was in the room just east of the Rope, and this room was in the 3rd column. This means that the rope was in the Hall at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  The Rope and the Poison were in the Hall and the Gazebo respectively at 11:30 PM, so the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Gazebo or the Hall at 11:30 PM.\n",

      "5.  The suspect motivated by Power moved from the Gazebo to the Dining Room at some point, and the suspect motivated by Power was in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM if and only if Miss Peach was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  Miss Peach moved from the Lounge to the Courtyard at 12:00 AM, but the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Gazebo to the Dining Room. So, the suspect motivated by Power was in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  The suspect motivated by Revenge was in the same room as the Lead Pipe, which was in the Kitchen with the Horseshoe at some point. This means that the Lead Pipe was in the Kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  The suspect motivated by Power was in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM and moved to the Dining Room at some point. Mrs. Peacock moved from the Courtyard to the Fountain at 12:00 AM, and if the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Gazebo to the Dining Room, then Miss Peach was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM.\n",

      "Explanation for A-F answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. To deduce who the murderer is, we examine all clues involving Mrs. Peacock and the other suspects and see who could have been with her at 01:00 AM, when she was in the Hall. From the clues, we know that Mr. Green was in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 12:00 AM and Colonel Mustard was in the room just east of Mr. Green at 01:00 AM. This gives us the layout Mr. Green -> Colonel Mustard -> Mrs. Peacock. From this chain, we conclude that Mr. Green could not have been in the Hall at 01:00 AM. Mrs. Peacock could have been with the following suspects - Mrs. White, Miss Scarlet, Miss Peach, Madame Rose, or Sergeant Gray from the clue \"Sgt. Gray was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 10:00 PM\". Then we look at the movements of these suspects at 10:00 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Mrs. White is in the same room as the Knife at 10:00 PM and the Knife is also the same room with Mr. Green at some point. \n",
      "- Miss Scarlet was in the same room as Madame Rose at 12:00 AM and is with Sergeant Gray at 11:00 PM. Miss Scarlet can't be the murderer since she moved from the Library at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "- Miss Peach moved from the Gazebo to the Hall at 01:00 AM and Miss Peach is in the same room with Sgt. Gray at 10:00 PM but both of them are in the opposite direction of the room where she would be at 01:00 AM from the clue \"Peach was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM\".\n",
      "- Madame Rose is in the Courtyard at 11:00 PM if and only if a suspect motivated by Pride was in the Carriage House at 11:00 PM and a suspect motivated by Betrayal moved from the Dining Room to the Courtyard at 11:00 PM. With this additional information, we know that Madame Rose is in the Courtyard at 11:00 PM.\n",
      " \n",
      "By process of elimination and examining all the clues, we see that Mrs. Peacock must be the one who was in the same room as Sgt. Gray at 10:00 PM and 01:00 AM and also found with the Wrench and the motive of Betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. To deduce the murder weapon, we look at the clues for each suspect who could be the murderer. We see that Mr. Boddy was in the Kitchen at 10:00 PM and the Wrench was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 01:00 AM. Then we examine the movements of the Wrench, which are covered in other clues, and we see that a suspect motivated by Pride moved the Wrench from somewhere to the Carriage House at some point in the night (10:00 PM or 01:00 AM). Then, a suspect motivated by Pride moved the Wrench from the Carriage House to the Gazebo at 01:00 AM and a suspect motivated by Anger moved the Lead Pipe from the Courtyard to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM. We see that the Lead Pipe and the Wrench are related in a way that they cannot both be moved from the Carriage House to the Gazebo. Therefore the Wrench was moved to the Carriage House at 01:00 AM, then to the Gazebo, therefore it can't be moved to the Gazebo at 01:00 AM. The Wrench was moved to the Carriage House at 10:00 PM. The Wrench is the same room as Mr. Boddy at 01:00 AM. Now we look for clues where the Wrench and Mr. Boddy are the same room at some other time. We find that A suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Courtyard at some point (09:00 PM or 12:00 AM) and that the Wrench and Knife are in different rooms at 10:00 PM. Then we see from the clue \"A suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Courtyard at 09:00 PM or Mr. Green was in the Lounge at 09:00 PM\", that the Wrench and Knife are in different rooms at 09:00 PM. Considering these clues we find that the Wrench was in the Kitchen at 10:00 PM and must have been in the same room as Mr. Boddy at some other time, which could be 01:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. To deduce where the murder was committed, we see that Mr. Boddy was in the kitchen at 11:00 PM. Looking at the clue that a suspect motivated by Anger moved the Lead Pipe from the Courtyard to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM and that the Knife and the Lead Pipe are in different rooms at 10:00 PM, we see that the Wrench and the Knife could have been in different rooms as well. To figure out which one the murder took place, we look for clues where the Wrench and the knife are in the same room at some other time. We see the Knife was in the same room as the Knife and Mrs. White at 10:00 PM and the Wrench was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 01:00 AM. From the clue \"The Knife was in the same room as Mrs. White at 10:00 PM\", we see that Mrs. White was in the Carriage House at 10:00 PM. Then we examine the movements of the Carriage House, which are covered in other clues, and see that a suspect motivated by Anger was in the Courtyard at 10:00 PM. Then we look at the room where the Lead Pipe was moved from the Courtyard to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM. We find that the Lead Pipe was not in the Kitchen and the Wrench was the same room as Mr. Boddy at 01:00 AM so the murder occurred in the Kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. To deduce when the murder occurred, we look at the clues involving the time of the murder. We see that a suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the courtyard at 09:00 PM or Mr. Green was in the Lounge at 09:00 PM. Then we see that Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen at 01:00 AM if and only if Mr. Boddy was in the Kitchen at 10:00 PM. Then, from the clue \"Mr. Boddy was in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM,\" we see that the suspect was either Mrs. Peacock or someone else at 10:00 PM. Looking at the clue that a suspect motivated by Anger moved the Wrench from the Courtyard to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM and that the Wrench was moved to the Carriage House at 10:00 PM, we see that the Wrench and the Lead Pipe are in the Kitchen at 01:00 AM and 12:00 AM respectively. To figure out when the murder occurred, we look at the movement of the Knife. We find that the Knife is related to Mrs. White and the Colonel Mustard and could not be moved to the Fountain. From the clue \"The Knife was in the same room as Mr. Green at some point\", we see the Knife could not be in the Gazebo at 01:00 AM and could not be moved to the Gazebo at 01:00 AM. Also, the Knife was in the same room as the Knife at 09:00 PM, but then the Wrench was in the Kitchen at 10:00 PM and the Wrench was the same room as Mr. Boddy at 01:00 AM. From the clue \"The Knife was in the same room as Mrs. White and the Knife was in the same room as the Lead Pipe\", we see that the Lead Pipe moved the Wrench from the Gazebo at 01:00 AM, then the Knife could not be in the Gazebo at 01:00 AM and then the Wrench was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 01:00 AM. Then we find the Lead Pipe was in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM. By looking at the movements of the Lead Pipe and the Knife we find that the Lead Pipe and the Knife are in the same room at 10:00 PM. Then we see the Lead Pipe was in the kitchen at 12:00 AM and the Lead Pipe was in the Courtyard at some other time. To figure out when the murder occurred, we look at the movements of the knife. We find that the Wrench and the Knife are in the same room at 10:00 PM. So the Wrench moved the murder weapon from the Kitchen to the Gazebo or some other place, then the Knife moved the Lead Pipe from the Courtyard at 12:00 AM and the Wrench moved the Lead Pipe at some point and possibly the Lead Pipe moved to the Gazebo. Then we see the Lead Pipe moved the Wrench from the Courtyard to the Gazebo. The Lead Pipe was moved from the Courtyard to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM. Then the murder occurred before 12 AM at 11:00 PM when the Wrench was in the Kitchen.\n",

      "Response:\n",
      "Let's analyze the clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given:\n",
      "- The Lead Pipe was in the Cloak Room if and only if the Wrench was in the Dining Room (1)\n",
      "- Mr. Boddy was in the same room as Mrs. White (2)\n",
      "- Mr. Boddy was killed with the Lead Pipe (3)\n",
      "- Sgt. Gray was in the Study (4)\n",
      "- Madame Rose was in the Gazebo (5)\n",
      "- The Wrench was in the room just south of the Rope (6)\n",
      "- Mrs. White was in the Cloak Room (7)\n",
      "- Monsieur Brunette was in the room just north of the Wrench (8)\n",
      "- Miss Peach was in the Study (9)\n",
      "\n",
      "From (7), we know Mrs. White is in the Cloak Room (4). Combining it with (2), we conclude that Mr. Boddy was also in the Cloak Room (4).\n",
      "\n",
      "From (1) and (7), we know the Lead Pipe was in the Cloak Room. Since Mr. Boddy was killed with the Lead Pipe (3), the murder must have taken place in the Cloak Room (4).\n",
      "\n",
      "From (8) and (1), we know the Wrench was in the Dining Room. Combining it with (6), we conclude the Rope is in the room just north of the Dining Room, which is the Gazebo (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "From (4), we know Mr. Boddy was in the Cloak Room with Mrs. White. Therefore, Mrs. White (2) is the murderer (A). The murder was in the Clak Room (B).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mrs. White cannot be in the same room as the Wrench (Dining Room or Gazebo), Sgt. Gray (4), Monsieur Brunette, nor Miss Peach (Study) can be in the same room as the rope or the wrench or both. Combining with (5) where Madame Rose is in the Gazebo, either Sgt. Gray or Miss Peach can be in the Gazebo to fulfill this condition (clue 6). Neither can be in the Dining Room because the Wrench would not be in the same room as Sgt. Gray and Miss Peach's room condition (Gazebo, Dining Room, or Cloak Room), so Sgt. Gray must be in the Kitchen (the only place left) where he is alone. Combining with (4), Miss Peach must be in the Gazebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Monsieur Brunette (8) was in the room just north of the Wrench. If Monsieur Brunette was in the Gazebo, the north of Wrench would imply that the Wrench is in the Study, which leads to a contradiction with (6). Therefore, Monsieur Brunette was in the dining room (9) which violates Clue 1. If Monsieur Brunette was in the Study, Monsieur Brunette and Miss Peach would be in the same room as the Rope (or either of them would be in the room just north of the rope and the other would be in the room just south of the rope, alongside Sgt. Gray and the Lead Pipe) and Miss Peach would be in the Study, which is another contradiction. This would make Sgt. Gray, Monsieur Brunette, and Miss Peach in the room with the Rope (Kitchen or Dining Room), which means either the Wrench would not be in the same room as the rope (Kitchen), or both the rope and wrench would have to be in the Clak Room, violating Clue 6. Therefore, the room just north of the Wrench must be the room just north of the Gazebo, the Studio (7).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Wrench and Rope could not be in the same room, the Wrench must be in the Dining Room. The Lead Pipe is in the Cloak Room (4), which leads to the conclusion that the Dining room and Gazebo cannot be at the same column. If the Gazebo was in a different column than the Dining Room, the Wrench would not be in the room just south of the Rope (6). This suggests that either Dining Room or Gazebo must be at the same column as the Cloak Room. The Gazebo cannot be at the same column as the Cloak Room because of (5). Thus, the Dining Room must be at the same column as the Cloak Room. However, this would imply the Lead Pipe and the Wrench are in the same room, which is not the case (1). This would also imply that Monsieur Brunette is in the room just north of the Wrench, and Monsieur Brunette is in the room north of the Dining Room, making it in contradiction with the Dining room having to be at the same column as the Cloak Room. If the Dining Room was in the same column as the Gazebo, this implies the Wrench was in the same room as the Rope which is not the case (1) and if Monsieur Brunette was in the room just north of the Wrench, Monsieur Brunette would be in the same column as the Dining Room and Gazebo at the same time. Since there are no other options left, it must be that (6) and (8) cannot be true. This implies the Wrench and Rope are in the same room, violating Clue 6. In this case, the Wrench and Rope are not on the W or E columns but on the North-South axis. If the Wrench and Rope are on the same row, it has to be the first row because the Gazebo is on the second row. Therefore, the Wrench must be at position (3), the Rope must be at position (1), and Monsieur Brunette can only be in position (2) which contradicts the information given in Clue 8, but since we cannot have the Wrench and the Rope in the same room in the remaining options, this is the only valid solution that satisfies the conditions from Clue 6 and this would make the empty grid as follows:\n",
      "```\n",
      "  N N MMM \n",
      "W R 3 4 E\n",
      "W 5 6 E\n",
      "  S S S  \n",
      "```\n",
      "Combine this with (8), we know Monsieur Brunette (M) must be in the room just north of the Wrench (3), which is the second column and room (2). \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus we now have all the information we need to fill out the solution:\n",

      "Note: The solution is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Revolver was always in the same room as a suspect motivated by Power or Sgt. Gray. Since Sgt. Gray was the suspect who moved the Revolver at some point, it can be concluded that Sgt. Gray was the killer.\n",
      "- The murderer was in the same room as the Wrench at 01:00 AM, which implies that the murderer was in the Billiard Room at 01:00 AM. This implies that the Wrench moved from the Ballroom to the Billiard Room at 12:30 AM or was moved by a suspect motivated by Power. Since Sgt. Gray was in the Ballroom at 01:30 AM and in the Trophy Room at 01:30 AM, and the murderer was in the same room as the Wrench at some point, we can conclude that the murderer moved the Wrench to the Billiard Room at some point.\n",
      "- The Wrench was in the Kitchen at 09:30 PM if and only if a suspect motivated by Power was in the Study at 10:00 PM. This implies that the Wrench must have moved from the Game Room to the Kitchen before it was in the Kitchen at 09:30 PM, which means Sgt. Gray must have moved it to the Kitchen before it was in the Kitchen at 09:30 PM.\n",
      "- The Wrench was in the room just east of Madame Rose at 09:30 PM, so it must have moved from the Kitchen to the room just east of Madame Rose before 09:30 PM, which means Sgt. Gray moved the Wrench from the Kitchen to 03 at 09:00 PM or earlier.\n",
      "- Since Sgt. Gray was in the room just west of the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM, the Wrench must have moved from the room just east of Madame Rose to the room just west of the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "- Since Sgt. Gray was in the Billiard Room at 01:30 AM and in the Trophy Room at 01:30 AM, and the murderer was in the same room as the Wrench at some point, we can conclude that the murderer moved the Wrench to the Billiard Room at 12:30 AM. Since Sgt. Gray was in the room just west of the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM, it means the Lead Pipe was in the room just east of Sgt. Gray at 01:00 AM. Since the Wrench must have moved from the room just east of Madame Rose to the room just west of the Lead Pipe, it implies that the Lead Pipe was in the room just east of Madame Rose.\n",
      "- Since the murderer must have had the Wrench at some point, and it was not in the Billiard Room at 09:30 PM, it means the Wrench must have moved from the room just east of Madame Rose to the Billiard Room before 09:30 PM.\n",
      "- Since the Wrench was in the Billiard Room at 01:00 AM if and only if Mr. Green was in the Study at 09:30 PM, and Mr. Green was not in the Study at 09:30 PM, it implies that the Wrench was not in the Billiard Room at 01:00 AM. Since the Wrench must have been in the Billiard Room at some point, it must have moved from the room just east of Madame Rose to the Billiard Room before 09:30 PM.\n",
      "- Since the Wrench was in the Ballroom at 09:30 PM if and only if a suspect motivated by Power was in the Study at 09:00 PM, and Sgt. Gray was in the room just west of the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM, it means Sgt. Gray must have moved the Wrench from the room just east of Madame Rose to the Ballroom before 09:00 PM.\n",
      "- Since the Wrench must have moved from the room just east of Madame Rose to the Ballroom before 09:00 PM, and Sgt. Gray must have moved the Wrench from the room just east of Madame Rose to the room just west of the Lead Pipe before 01:00 AM, we can conclude that the Wrench was in the room just east of Sgt. Gray at 10:00 PM.\n",
      "- Since Sgt. Gray was in the Trophy Room at 01:30 AM, and the Wrench must have been in the room just west of the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM, it implies that the Lead Pipe was in the room just east of Sgt. Gray at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "- Since the murderer must have had the Wrench at some point, it was in the Trophoy Room at 09:30 PM.\n",
      "- Since the Wrench was in the Billiard Room at 01:00 AM if and only if Mr. Green was in the Study at 09:30 PM, and Mr. Green was not in the Study at 09:30 PM, it implies that the Wrench was not in the Billiard Room at 01:00 AM. Since the Wrench must have been in the Billiard Room at some point, it must have moved from the Ballroom to the Billiard Room at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "- Since Sgt. Gray was in the room just west of the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM, we can conclude that the Wrench was in the room just east of Sgt. Gray at 01:00 AM. However, the Wrench must have moved to the Billiard Room at 12:30 AM. This means Sgt. Gray moved the Wrench from the Ballroom to the room just east of Sgt. Gray before 01:00 AM. This can only occur if Sgt. Gray was in the room just east of Sgt. Gray at some point.\n",
      "- Since the Wrench was in the Billiard Room at 01:30 AM if and only if Sgt. Gray was in the 03 at 09:30 PM, and Sgt. Gray was not in the 03 at 09:30\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The murder weapon was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 12:00 AM. From clue 6, the murder weapon was the Wrench, and since the Wrench was in the room just south of the Candlestick at 12:00 AM, this implies Mrs. Peacock was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Since the Candlestick was in the room just north of the Wrench at 11:00 PM, it must be in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM, implying the murderer was in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- If Mrs. Peacock was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM, she must be the one in the Ballroom at 11:00 PM from clue 4.\n",
      "- Since Miss Peach and Mrs. Peacock are in the Ballroom and Conservatory respectively at 11:00 PM, Miss Peach must be in the room to the south of Mrs. Peacock (the room just north of Miss Peach was the Conservatory which was Miss Peach's location), meaning it must be Room 2 (S) and therefore Conservatory.\n",
      "- Since the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM and in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM, it is Mrs. Peacock, because she is the only suspect who can be in both the Conservatory and Ballroom at the 2 times given that she was already deduced to be in the Ballroom at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- The only place for the suspect motivated by Power at 11:00 PM to be is Room 1, so the answer for F is Ballroom at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- Mr. Boddy was in the Ballroom at 11:00 PM, and by the assumption that the kill was late in the night, sometime after 11:00 PM, Mr. Boddy and the murder weapon must have been alone together between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM. Since Mr. Boddy and the Ballroom area were already deduced to be in the Ballroom area, and we know the Ballroom was the only place the Power motive was possible at 11:00 PM, and all that will not be used by the killer later, the Power motive at 11:00 PM must have been Mrs. Peacock. The problem only states \"has been narrowed down to one of the times\" for the murder, which implies it can still be at 11 PM.\n",

      "G. The Gazebo\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The murderer was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM or a suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Gazebo at 12:30 AM (Clue 8). This means that the murderer could be either Colonel Mustard (in the Trophy Room) or someone motivated by Hatred (in the Gazebo).\n",
      "2. A suspect motivated by Anger moved the Lead Pipe from the Lounge to the Gazebo at 12:15 AM (Clue 17). Since the Lead Pipe was moved, a suspect motivated by Anger was in the Lounge at 11:45 AM. The murderer was not Colonel Mustard at 11:45 PM, so the suspect motivated by Anger was the murderer.\n",
      "3. Mrs. White was in the same room as Sgt. Gray at 12:00 AM (Clue 11). If Mrs. White and Sgt. Gray were in the same room on the main floor, there would be a conflict with Clue 23, which says Sgt. Gray was in the Drawing Room at 11:30 PM. Thus, Mrs. White and Sgt. Gray must be on an off-diagonal room. Since Mrs. White was not in the Billiard Room or the Lounge (Clue 18), and Colonel Mustard was in the Billiard Room, Mrs. White and Sgt. Gray must have been in the room marked \"12\" (Ballroom).\n",
      "4. The Horseshoe was in the room just south of Mr. Green at 11:30 PM (Clue 1). This means Mr. Green was not on the main diagonal, and the Horseshoe was either in the Ballroom, the Drawing Room, or the Conservatory. Since the Horseshoe was in the Drawing Room at 12:30 AM (Clue 25), it cannot be that the Horseshoe was in the Ballroom or the Conservatory.\n",
      "5. A suspect motivated by Anger was in the same room as the Candlestick at 11:30 PM (Clue 13). Since the Candlestick is in the Drawing Room (Clue 25), the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Drawing Room at 11:30 PM. This means the murderer, Sgt. Gray, was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "6. Colonel Mustard was in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM (Clue 23) and moved to the Gazebo at 11:45 PM (Clue 32). At this time, the murderer was not in the Gazebo, so the murderer was in the Billiard Room. At 11:45 PM, the murderer could not be Sgt. Gray, so Colonel Mustard was the murderer, or the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Gazebo. At 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM, so Colonel Mustard was the murderer.\n",
      "7. The murderer used the Knife (Clue 1). \n",
      "8. The murder occurred at the Billiard Room (Clue 23).\n",
      "9. The murder occurred at 12:00 AM or 11:45 PM is not possible (Clues 8 and 9). The Killer was alone with a weapon at this time.\n",
      "10. Colonel Mustard moved the Horseshoe from the Kitchen at 11:30 PM to the Lounge at 11:45 PM, and moved to the Gazebo at 11:45 PM (Clues 1 and 14). He committed the murder then because the conflict between the Lead Pipe and Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "11. Colonel Mustard's motive is anger because he moved the Lead Pipe from the Lounge at 11:45 PM.\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "We can start by narrowing down the possible suspects. Given that the Wrench and Poison were in the Courtyard together at least once, and Miss Scarlet was in the room just north of the Wrench at 09:00 PM, but she wasn't in the Courtyard at 09:00 PM. This indicates that the Wrench was in the Courtyard before 09:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the Horseshoe was in the same room as the Poison at 04:00 AM, which helped us narrow down the locations of these two objects further. Given that the Horseshoe was in the same room as Miss Scarlet at 07:00 PM, and the Horseshoe was in the same room as the Poison at 04:00 AM, these two objects must have been in the same room at 04:00 AM as well, which we know is the Library. This means that at 07:00 PM, the Horseshoe could not have been in the Library.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we can deduce the locations of the Horseshoe and Poison. The Horseshoe was in the same room as Sgt. Gray at 04:00 AM as well, and the Horseshoe was in the same room as Sgt. Gray and the Wrench at some point. As the Wrench must have been in the Courtyard before 09:00 PM, we can deduce that it must have moved from the Courtyard to the Cloak Room at 04:00 AM (as Sgt. Gray was in the Courtyard at 03:00 AM) and then moved to the Hall at 04:00 AM. However, the Horseshoe must have moved in the opposite direction, meaning the Horseshoe moved from the Hall to the Cloak Room at 04:00 AM, which solved the earlier paradox that Sgt. Gray was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM, who must now be the suspect motivated by Jealousy. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can now narrow down who the murderer must be, considering the suspect motivated by Ambition moved the Poison from the Courtyard to the Studio at 10:00 PM. This indicates that the Poison must have been in the Courtyard at 10:00 PM, and the suspect motivated by Ambition and Poison were in the Courtyard and Studio, respectively. The suspect motivated by Ambition must have moved from the Library to the Studio at 11:00 PM (the alternative would result in a prior contradiction), thus narrowing down our suspects to Sergeant Gray and the suspect motivated by Ambition.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when combining these clues, the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Courtyard at 08:00 PM and was in the Studio at 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM. This brought forth a contradiction and tells us that Sergeant Gray must be the suspect motivated by Ambition.\n",

      "Solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the murder weapon was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 11:00 PM, it is not in the Courtyard. Given that the Horseshoe was in the Courtyard at 11:00 PM, it follows that the Knife is not in the Courtyard at any point of interest. Since the Knife was in the room just west of Mrs. White, Mrs. White must be in the Hall, Billiard Room, or Studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue that \"The suspect motivated by Hatred moved from the Conservatory to the Courtyard at 11:30 PM\" and \"The murderer moved from the Courtyard to the Conservatory at 11:30 PM\", it follows that the murderer did not motivate from Hatred. Since the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, and cannot have moved from the Courtyard to the Conservatory, this suspect is in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM. The murderer cannot be this person since the murderer has to be in the Courtyard at 11:30 PM. This suspect must be Mrs. Peacock since it's the only other possible person in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since only two suspects are left, either Mrs. White or Mrs. Peacock, it remains to figure out which one is the murderer. Let us denote the murder weapon \"W\" and use the available clues to deduce more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "- If the murder weapon was in the Hall at some point, then Mrs. White must have been in the Hall at 12:00 AM and Mrs. White and the murderer were in the same room at 12:00 AM. If the murder weapon was in the Hall at 11:30 PM, Mrs. Peacock would have been able to murder Mr. Boddy at 11:30 PM, which is impossible since she was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM. So, the murder weapon was not in the Hall at 11:30 PM. But, if the murder weapon was in the Hall at 12:00 AM, then Mrs. Peacock must have moved from the Hall to the Conservatory at 12:00 AM, however she was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM. This is impossible, so the murder weapon was in the Hall at 11:00 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Following the above deduction, only Mrs. White could have murdered Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the clue \"The Knife was in the room just east of Mr. Boddy at 11:00 PM\", the murder weapon wasn't in the Hall at 11:00 PM, which means it was in the room just west of the Hall (room 3). The murder weapon must have been in the Studio at 11:00 PM, so it must have been the Knife. The Knife was in the Studio, so it must have been in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM. It follows that the Greed suspect must be Mrs. White since she was in the Studio at 11:30 PM according to the clue \"Mrs. White was in the Studio at 12:00 AM if and only if the murder weapon was in the Hall at 11:30 PM\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that the murder took place in the Hall at 11:30 PM, it was the only possible time that satisfies all the given information. \n",
      "\n",
      "The killer moved from the Courtyard to the Conservatory at 11:30 PM and was in the room that has at least one weapon at the time, which can be none since there is no possible room for any weapon at that time. However, since the murderer was in the room with the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM and moved to the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, it is possible to place the Horseshoe in the Hall. Since only two suspects are left Mrs. Peacock and Colonel Mustard, only Colonel Mustard can motivate from Pride since the suspect from Pride moved from the Hall to the Conservatory at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue that the suspects were together at some point: \"Colonel Mustard was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 11:00 PM\" it follows that Colonel Mustard and Mrs. Peacock were in the room containing the Knife at 11:00 PM and they were together at 11:00 PM. It cannot be the case that both Mrs. Peacock and Colonel Mustard are suspects with a motive since only one room must contain at least one weapon at the time of the murder. Since the murderer must be Mrs. White, both of these clues indicate that Mrs. Peacock's motive can be Hatred.\n",

      "*   The suspect motivated by Greed was in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM (Hence, the Wrench is in the Lounge at 12:00 AM).\n",

      "*   The Wrench is in the room just north of the Lounge.\n",

      "*   A Suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Ballroom at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "*   The Horseshoe was in the Study at 11:00 PM (since the Horseshoe is the murder weapon). \n",
      "    - Given that the Horseshoe was in the Study at 11:00 and in the room east of Mr. Green at 12, Along with the Horseshoe's room being east of the Lounge, it indicates that Mr. Green was east of the Horseshoe at 12:00.  \n",
      "    - Mr. Green was in the Billiard room at 11:00 due to him being the suspect who motivated Betrayal. (Mr Green was in the Carriage house at 11 due to Miss Peach in carriage house at 12)\n",
      "The set of actions does not sum up as planned and only works if the entire setup is moved north in the layout. By updating our interpretation, at 11:00. Mr. Green was in the room east of the Lounge at 11:00 and so Wrench must be moving, in the current alignment at lunch table is NSNS and Catering is NSNE W means the revolver wasn't there at 11, but it can come from the study (where Mr. Boddy must go to create a solution) so the knife and the Revolver are in different rooms at 11 (knife and the Revolver cannot be together on the North NSEW SSENNE at 11)\n",
      "  \n",
      " The Revolver can move from the study, but we need the revolver to move to the Lounge, so we must move 1 space to the west (where we have turned the people to place them in North-South rows from left to right from top to bottom on our grid and turned them back to W, east-west rows) It is likely the study and the Lounge must then be north of the dining room so Mrs White in the lounge must be in the north of the study at 11:00 PM. If Mrs. White was there, and if the motive for Betrayal was on the carriage house at 11 it makes sense that Mr. Green must be there. From our set of actions above Mrs. White is not in the carriage house and must be in the room sandwiching the study so it shows that Mrs. White is in the room where the dinner (the study) is not; Then it is found that Mrs. White is in the dining room. Mrs White is in the study with the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM. (Again the person must be the one to move for compulsory work), we add the finalized setup.

      "\n",
      "To deduce the murder, let's analyze the given clues step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Candlestick and Professor Plum were in the Hall together at least once. This means that the Hall must have had a Candlestick at some point in the night. This implies one of the following scenarios for the Candlestick:\n",
      "- The Candlestick was moved to the Hall at some point in the night, and then moved from the Hall at 12:00 AM. This implies that the Candlestick was in the Lounge at 11:45 PM (clue 3), which gives a constraint that the Lounge did not have the Candlestick at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- The Candlestick was in the Hall initially and the Professor Plum moved it out of the Hall at some point in the night. However, this would mean Professor Plum had the Candlestick at 12:00 AM, which contradicts the information that the Candlestick was in the Hall at 12.00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that Professor Plum is motivated by Anger. If the suspects were alone with at least one weapon in the night at some point, they could have only interacted at the time of the murder, because the number of suspects who interacted at 11:45 PM (0, 1, or 2) must be less than the number of suspects who interacted at 12:00 AM (1, 2 or 3). \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Sgt. Gray moved to the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, Sgt. Gray interacted with at least one of the other two suspects. Additionally, Mrs. Peacock moved from the Lounge to the Hall at 12:00 AM and Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 12:00 AM if and only if the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Hall at 12:00 AM (clue 11). Thus, since Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Hall at 12:00 AM, which implies the motive for Mrs. Peacock was not Betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Poison was in the same room as the Lead Pipe at 12:00 AM (clue 10) and the Poison was in the Fountain at least once with Mr. Boddy (clue 8). Since there is only one room left which the Lead Pipe could be in (the Billiard is the only room the Lead Pipe and Poison are likely to be in together), if the Lead Pipe is in the Billiard, then the Poison is also in the Billiard at 12:00 AM. However, the Lead Pipe must be in the Billiard at 11:45 PM since at 12:00 AM the Lead Pipe moved from the Hall, but the Lead Pipe is the only weapon in the Billiard room, and the number of the suspects who are alone with at least one weapon in the night is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since one of the rooms must be the murder site, and the murder weapon is the Poison, the murder must be in the room where the Candlestick was at 12:00 AM, which must be the room where the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in 12:00 AM (clue 11). The suspect motivated by Betrayal is in the Hall at 11:45 PM or the suspect motivated by Betrayal is in the Lounge at 12:00 AM, and since at 11:45 PM the number of people in the Lounge is one, the suspect motivated by Betrayal must be either in the Lounge or the Hall at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Betrayal must be in the room with the Lead Pipe and the Poison, so the Lead Pipe was not in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM. This implies another scenario for the Lead Pipe:\n",
      "- The Lead Pipe moved to the Billiard at 11:45 PM and stayed there. If it was in the Hall at 11:45 PM, the number of people who interacted at 11:45 PM would be 3, but at 12:00 PM the number of people who interacted would be 3. The number of the suspects who interacted at 11:45 PM must be less than the number of people who interacted at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Lead Pipe is the only weapon in the Billiard and the number of the suspects who interacted at 11:45 PM must be less than the number at 12, the Lead pipe must have been in the Hall at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hall could be in two possible rooms because at 12:00 AM the Lead Pipe moved from the Hall, and the Hall could have been one of the two rooms the Lodge and the Billiard (this is a result of Knight rule).\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 10 we know that the Lead Pipe and Poison were in the same room. Because the Hall is the room the Lead Pipe is in at 12:00 AM, the Hall is the room the Poison is also in at 12:00 AM. This means the Lead Pipe must have been moved out of the Billiard to the Hall if the Hall is the Billiard. Since there are people who stayed in the Hall, the Hall is not the Lodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Hall were the Lodge, the Candlestick would be in the Billiard. Then at 12:00 AM the number of the people who interacted would be 3. However, since Sgt. Gray moved to the Billiard room at 11:45 PM,  the number of the people who interacted at 11:45 PM is 3 which contradicts the fact that the number of the people who interacted at 11:45 is less than the number at 12:00.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clues 7 and 6, we know that the Candlestick was in the Hall at 11:45 PM. Since there is only one possible scenario where the Hall could be the Lodge (the number of people would be 3, which contradicts the fact that the number of the people who interacted at 11:45 PM is less than the number at 12:00.), the Hall is the Billiard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since at 12:00 AM the Lead Pipe moved from the Hall, it is the Hall that is the fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Fountain were the Lounge, the Candlestick would be in the Billiard. Then at 12:00 AM the number of people who interacted is 3 which would contradict clues 3 that it is not possible. Therefore, the number of people who interacted  11:45 PM can't be 3. The Hall is the Billiard, the number of people at  11:45 PM is 0, and the number of people at 12:00 AM is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because there is only one possible room for the Fountain and the Hall being the Billiard would mean that at 11:45 PM the number of people would be 0, the number of people who interacted at 11:45 PM must be 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only room left is the Lounge. The only time left for the murder is 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The murder must be in the Lounge, because it was the room that had the Lead Pipe at 11:45 and had the Candlestick at 12:00. But we also know that it is not possible that at 11:45 the Lounge and the Hall had people, so the Lounge is the room the murder happened in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Sgt. Gray moved to the Billiard room at 12:00, and the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Hall at 11:45 PM, the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Billiard at 12:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 9 we know that at 12:00 the murder weapon is the Poison, and the murder must be in the Lounge, which would mean the murder weapon was the Poison at 11:45 and at 11:45 the murder must be in the Lounge.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 2 we know the murder weapon was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM if and only if Miss Scarlet was in the Hall at 12:00 AM. Thus, the murder weapon is in the Lounge at 11:45 PM and at 12:00 AM, and Miss Scarlet was not in the Hall at 12:00 AM, so Miss Scarlet was not the murder weapon in the Lounge at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since at 11:45 PM, the murder weapon was the Poison, and at 12:00 PM the murder must be in the Lounge: The only weapon we haven't accounted for yet is the Poison, so it was the murder weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 11:45 PM, the murder must be in the Lounge, the lead pipe must be in the Billiard, but one clue given that the Poison is in the same room as the lead pipe contradicts the puzzle.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes no sense so the Puzzle has a bug.\n",

      "{'A': 'Mr. Green', 'B': 'Candlestick', 'C': 'Library', 'D': 'Jealousy', 'E': 'Dining Room', 'F': 'Carriage House', 'G': 'Mr. Green', 'H': 'Dining Room'} \n",
      "Response:\n",
      "A. Mrs. Peacock\n",
      "B. Candlestick\n",
      "C. Library\n",
      "D. Revenge\n",
      "E. Dining Room\n",
      "F. Cloak Room\n",
      "G. Miss Peach\n",
      "H. Dining Room\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer was obtained by systematically analyzing all the clues and suspect movements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, there are two groups of suspects motivated by Betrayal and Revenge.  We know the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Cloak Room at 10:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Sgt. Gray was with Mrs. Peacock during 11:15 PM, he was in the Dining Room or the Library. Mrs. Peacock moved to the Library at 11:00 PM, so Sgt. Gray must have been in the Dining Room at 11:00 PM. Since Sgt. Gray was in the Dining Room earlier, he cannot be re-evaluated from this point on.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know a suspect motivated by Revenge was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 11:00 PM. Mrs. Peacock and Madame Rose were not in the room with Mr. Boddy at 11:00 PM, so this must be either Mr. Green or Miss Peach. We also know a suspect motivated by Revenge moved from the Dining Room to the Courtyard at 11:30 PM. This must be Mrs. Peacock, as she was at the Dining Room earlier, and Mrs. Peacock is the only suspect that was at the Dining Room and the Library at some point in the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the suspects with revenge are Ms. Peach and Mr. Green. Miss Peach moved from the Kitchen to the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM. If Miss Peach was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM, and then moved to the Cloak Room at 11:15 PM, the suspect motivated by Betrayal must be in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM. Also, this implies that the murders weapon was in the Billiard Room or the Kitchen at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Candlestick was in the Billiard Room at 10:45 PM and the Wrench was in the Billiard Room at 10:45 PM. Since the Revolver was in the same room as the Poison at 11:15 PM, there must have been a previous Firearm in the room with the Poison at 11:15 PM. This gives the possible room combinations (Billiard, Study, Dining, Carriage House), with the possible murder weapon being Poison, Wrench, Candlestick, or nothing. Since the murder weapon was in the Carriage House at 10:45 PM, Mr. Boddy could be murdered with the Wrench at 11:00, 11:15, or 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study is the only room where the murder doesn't start and end on the 45's. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Dining Room and moved to the Library at 11:00 PM and was in the Dining Room at 11:45 PM, she cannot be the killer. Mr. Boddy and Mrs. Peacock were in the Dining Room together at least once, which must have been at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also know the murderer was in the Library at 12:00 AM. This would mean that Mrs. Peacock was murdered with the Candlestick in the library at 11:45 PM (B. Wrench is in the Billiard) or 11:15 (the murder time), and this would not be possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know Mr. Boddy was in the Library at 11:30 PM. Thus we conclude that the murder was committed with the Wrench in the study at 11:45 PM, excluding Wrench from being a possible murder weapon. Since the murder must have occurred with the Poison, it must have been at 11:45 PM in the study with the murder weapon and Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Mr. Boddy being in the Library at 11:30 PM and Mr. Green being in the Library at 10:45 PM, Mr. Green cannot be the killer. This eliminates Ms. Peach as the killer and leaves only Mrs. Peacock as the person capable of committing the murder from the suspects with revenge or betrayal. This finalizes the fact that Mrs. Peacock is the killer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Miss Peach was in the room west of the suspect with Revenge, and Revenge was in the Library, she was in the room just west of the Library (at least at 11:45 PM), which is the Study. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Sgt. Gray and Mrs. Peacock were in the Dining Room at the same time, and Mrs. Peacock moved to the Library at 11:00 PM, and Mrs. Peacock was in the Dining Room at 11:45 PM, we know Sgt. Gray was in the room north of the study (Kitchen or Courtyard) at 11:00 PM. Since Sgt. Gray moved to the Dining Room, the Courtyard at 12:00 AM and he must be in another room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clues, Miss Peach is either in the Billiard or the Kitchen at 11:00 PM. Since she was in the kitchen at 11:15 PM with the murderer not being in the kitchen, the killer or Mrs. Peacock was already in the study and must be Mrs. Peacock at 11:00 PM, not the killer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Sgt. Gray was at the Dining Room at 11:15 PM, he was at the Dining room and was not in the Library.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Mrs. Peacock's motive being Revenge and Colonel Mustard being in the same room as Miss Peach at 10:45 PM, Colonel Mustard must be the suspect motivated by Jealousy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsieur Brunette was in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM if and only if Miss Peach was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM. Mrs. Peacock was at the Library at 11:30 PM and Monsieur Brunette was at the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM. Since Monsieur Brunette was in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM, he must have been at the Billiard Room at 10:45 PM and moved to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM with Mrs. Peacock at the Library at 12:00 AM, his conditions are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Library at 11:30 PM and Mrs. Peacock was the murderer, the murderer was also in the Library at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 11:45 PM, the murderer was in the Library and the killer could not be in the Library. This means the killer moved out and was now in a new location. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Madame Rose moved to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM and Sgt. Gray moved to the Dining Room at 12:00 AM, at 11:45 PM, they must have been in the Library. Also, the murderer moved to the Library at 11:30 PM and moved from the Library at 11:45 PM. So, Sgt. Gray moved to the Library after Madame Rose left, since Madame rose moved to the Library at 11:00 PM and Madame Rose moved to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM. \n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM, so the suspect motivated by Hatred was not in the Library at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Peacock was in the Dining Room at 11:45 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the Library at 11:30 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "We know that the Candlestick was in the Billiard Room at 10:45 PM, and there was no possible location for the Candlestick at 11:45 PM. The Candlestick was in the billiard at 11:00 PM or in the studio at 10:45 PM. The Wrench was in the Billiard Room at 10:45 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the Candlestick was in the Studio at 10:45 PM and then moved to the Library at 11:00 PM. This implies that Mr. Green was in the Library at 10:45 PM since the Candlestick was in the Library at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the murder must have been  done by Mrs. Peacock at 11:45 PM with the poison in the Study, eliminating the Wrench and eliminating Mr. Green as the possible killer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Peacock was murdered at 11:45 PM in the Library, so she cannot be motivated by Jealousy. Therefore, she must be motivated by Revenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The murder was committed in the Library, the section MC at  Coroner is Section 01.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Madame Rose being in the room to the right of the poison at 11:30 PM, Mrs. Peacock was in the room to the west of the Dining Room at 11:00 PM, the murder was with the poison in the Study at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Peacock was in the room just west of Sgt. Gray at 11:45 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the Dining room at 11:45 PM. Given that Sgt. Gray was in the kitchen or the Courtyard at 11:00 PM, it must be the dining room at 11:45 PM where Mrs. Peacock was.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",

      "1. The first step is to establish the positions of the Rope and Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM. We know that Mr. Boddy was in a room just south of the Rope at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. At 11:30 PM, the Rope was in the room just north of Mr. Green, who must have been in a room adjacent to the room Mr. Boddy would be in at 12:00 AM (since Mr. Boddy was in a room just south of the Rope at 12:00 AM). Since the Rope moved between rooms, the Mr. Green and the Rope must have moved to their positions at 11:30 PM within these rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. This means Mr. Boddy, Green, and the Rope must be in a row at 11:30 PM (since Mr. Green is in a room adjacent to the Rope's room at this time, and Mr. Boddy is in a room adjacent to the Rope's room at 12:00 AM).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Mrs. White staying in her current room or moving to an adjacent room would require her and the Rope to be in the same room, but this would contradict the clue that the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the same room as the Rope at 11:30 PM. This means Mrs. White had to be in a room adjacent but not east or west of the Rope at 11:30 PM. This information rules out the Gazebo for Mrs. White.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Focusing on Mr. Green and the Rope: Considering the Rope must have been in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM to be in the room just south of Mr. Boddy, it means the Rope was also in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM, putting Mr. Green in the room just south of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. By elimination and  deduction, the suspect motivated by Ambition must be Mrs. White because the other person in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM would be in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, meaning they must be the suspect motivated by Jealousy.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Since the only rooms where the suspect motivated by Ambition could not be at 12:00 AM are the Gazebo and the room just north of the Rope's room, the Rope (and therefore the suspect motivated by Ambition) must be in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "8. Mrs. White being in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM with the revolvers implication that the murder weapon is the Rope, with Mrs. White being the suspect motivated by Ambition, and Mrs. White in the Billiard room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Because Mrs. White must have been in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM with the Rope, and she was also in the Billiard Room with the Rope at 12:00 AM, then the murder must have happened in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM.\n",

      "To answer the question about who murdered Mr. Boddy, we start from the fact that the murderer was in the Dining Room at 02:00 AM. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"The murderer and Mr. Boddy were in the Dining Room together at least once\", we can conclude that Mr. Boddy stayed in the Dining Room either 01:00 AM to 02:00 AM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mr. Boddy was in the Hall at 10:00 PM, he must have moved to the Dining Room at 11:00 PM. From the clue \"The Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 11:00 PM\", we can conclude that Mr. Boddy was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the Lead Pipe was in the room just north of Professor Plum at 09:00 PM, Professor Plum was in the Billiard Room at 09:00 PM, and the Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 11:00 PM, we need to eliminate Professor Plum since he was in the Billiard Room at 09:00 PM, but we do not know about his movement to the Study at 12:00 AM. So let's consider the other possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only other suspects who may be connected to the Lead Pipe and the murder are the suspects motivated by Hatred, Jealousy, or Power since the suspects motivated by Betrayal or Anger could have been eliminated from the possibilities at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"Mrs. Peacock was in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM if and only if Miss Peach was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM\", we can conclude that Miss Peach is not in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM, so Mrs. Peacock is not the suspect motivated by Power.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"The suspect motivated by Power and the Wrench were in the Conservatory together at least once\", we can conclude that the suspect motivated by Power was not in the Conservatory at any time that the Wrench was not there, meaning the suspect motivated by Power did not move the Wrench. Hence, the suspect motivated by Power is not Mrs. Peacock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the suspect motivated by Power was in the Ballroom at 10:00 PM, we can conclude that Mrs. Peacock is the suspect motivated by Hatred. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Conservatory at 02:00 AM or the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Ballroom at 10:00 PM\", we can conclude that Mrs. Peacock is not the suspect motivated by Hatred at 02:00 AM, meaning she must be the suspect motivated by Hatred at 02:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"The murder weapon was in the Hall at 09:00 PM if and only if Mrs. Peacock was in the Ballroom at 09:00 PM\", we can conclude Mr. Boddy stayed in the Ballroom at 09:00 PM, and Mrs. Peacock was in the Ballroom at 09:00 PM. However, this conflicts with the clue \"The Candlestick was in the Ballroom at 09:00 PM\" and \"Madame Rose was in the room just north of Mr. Boddy at 09:00 PM\" since Mrs. Peacock's room must have been the Ballroom at that time. Thus, from the clue \"The suspect motivated by Power was in the Ballroom at 10:00 PM\", we can conclude the suspect motivated by Power was: Madame Rose. However, this conflicts with the clue \"The suspect motivated by Power was in the Ballroom at 02:00 AM\", meaning Mrs. Peacock cannot be the suspect motivated by Power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only possible choices left for Mrs. Peacock are the Hall, Jealousy, Hatred, and the Lead Pipe. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 10:00 PM, Mrs. Peacock was either in the Hall at 11:00 PM or the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM. Mrs. Peacock could then move the Lead Pipe to the Hall at 11:00 PM and use it at 12:00 AM for Jealousy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Mrs. Peacock moved to the Hall at 11:00 PM via north, stayed there until 01:00 AM, and moved to the Dining Room at 02:00 AM. \n",

      "From the clue \"The Candelstick was in the room just north of Miss Scarlet at 12:00 AM,\" and \"The Candlestick was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 10:00 PM\" we infer that at 10:00 PM, Mr. Boddy was in the same room just north of Miss Scarlet. Given the grid layout, the possible location is room 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue \"Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) was in the room just north of the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM\" means the murder did not occur between 10:00 PM and 01:00 AM. Now, let's consider the moves of Professor Plum, a suspect motivated by Ambition and the Poison's location. At 10:00 PM, the Poison was in the room just south of the Candlestick, and at 11:00 PM, the Poison was either in the Billiard Room or Miss Scarlet was in the Drawing Room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the \"A suspect motivated by Ambition moved from the Trophy Room to the Courtyard at 11:00 PM.\" This must imply the suspect was Miss Scarlet and that there is a connection between Miss Scarlet and the Courtyard, so the Poison must be in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "This implies Madame Rose or Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard, given that Professor Plum was in the Courtyard at 10:00 PM. This makes it likely that Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard at 10:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider moving the Lead Pipe. \"A suspect motivated by Ambition moved the Lead Pipe from the Billiard Room to the Courtyard at 01:00 AM\" This leads to the following inferences: if Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard, then Madame Rose was in the Billiard Room. Since the murderer was in the Trophy Room at 10:00 PM and a suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM, this implies Mr. Boddy's presence in the Billiard Room is a threat to the murderer, which is not possible at 01:00 AM; hence Mr. Boddy was not in the Courtyard, making the previous inference about Madame Rose correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Miss Peach is motivated by Ambition and was also in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, it follows that at 10:00 PM, Miss Peach was not in the Billiard Room and the revolver could not be in the Trophy Room. Now, deducing the possible locations and the motive, we find that Miss Peach was indeed in the Billiard Room at 10:00 PM, given Miss Scarlet was in the Drawing Room, which makes room 4 the only option for the Trophy Room at 10:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can determine the location of the murder. Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard at 10:00 PM, given all the inferences. Since Monsieur Brunette was in the room just north of the Lead Pipe, Monsieur Brunette must be in the same room as the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM. This leads to Monsieur Brunette being in the Trophy Room at 10:00 PM when he is not alone in a room with at least one weapon; however, the possible locations of the murder at that time lead to an incorrect conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the available information, let's back track to find the correct location. At 11:00 PM, the Lead Pipe could not be in the room with the suspect motivated by power in the Trophy Room. This means the Lead Pipe must be in the Courtyard at 10:00 PM, since the suspect who moved the Lead Pipe from the Billiard Room to the Courtyard at 01:00 AM. This leads to the conclusion that Mr. Boddy was in the room just north of the Lead Pipe. This further implies that the murderer and Mr. Boddy were alone in a room with at least one weapon at 11:00 PM, which is the correct time for the murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the inferences from previous steps, this places Mr. Boddy in the same room as the Lead Pipe, and the location the Poetry. Thus, the #2 spot is the location of the murder and the Lead Pipe is the murder weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's consider the suspects and motives. The suspect motivated by Power in the Trophy Room at 10:00 PM could be a possible suspect, given that Miss Scarlet moved from the Trophy Room to the Courtyard at 10:00 PM. The crime could have occurred in the #2 room, which means that Miss Peach or Miss Scarlet was in the #2 room. Since Miss Peach was not alone with a weapon, she cannot be the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 10:00 PM, Miss Scarlet was in the Drawing Room or the room just north of the Lead Pipe. Since the Lead Pipe was in the Courtyard and the murder weapon was in the Trophy Room, Miss Scarlet cannot be in the #2 room. The suspect motivated by Power cannot be in the Trophy Room at 10:00 PM, so it must be Madame Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now consider possible inferences about motives. With Madame Rose in the room to the north of the Lead Pipe, she had opportunity to move the lead pipe, making Madame Rose the suspect who moved the Lead Pipe at 01:00 AM and is motivated by Power. This still leaves g the possibility that Madame Rose killed Mr. Boddy in the #2 room, where Mr. Boddy was in the company of the Lead Pipe. A possible conclusion that Madame Rose is the killer and the Lead Pipe is the murder weapon.\n",

      "C. Carriage House\n",
      "D. Greed\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "From the clue that \"The suspect motivated by Greed was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM if and only if the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Carriage House at 03:00 AM\", we know that Mrs. Peacock was the suspect motivated by Greed at 12:00 AM, because we can eliminate the other suspects with the other motives at that time. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"The Wrench was in the Hall at 01:00 AM if and only if Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen at 01:00 AM\" and the clue \"The Candlestick was in the Carriage House at 01:00 AM if and only if the Wrench was in the Hall at 01:00 AM\", we can conclude that Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"Mrs. Peacock was in the same room as the Revolver at 02:00 AM\", we can deduce that Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 02:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the suspect motivated by Greed was in the room with the revoler at 02:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Greed must have moved the Revolver to the Carriage House at 03:00 AM from the Kitchen, in which Mrs. Peacock was at 03:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also know that ''The suspect motivated by Fear moved the Candlestick from the Studio to the Carriage House at 12:00 AM```, so the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Studio at 12:00 AM. From the clue \"The suspect motivated by Greed was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM if and only if the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Carriage House at 03:00 AM\", we know that Mrs. Peacock was not the suspect motivated by Fear. The only one left that could be the suspect motivated by Fear is the person with this motive at 02:00 AM (\"The suspect motivated by Fear moved from the Carriage House to the Studio at 02:00 AM\"). Thus, the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Studio at 02:00 AM, because it had to be the same person with this motive at 2:00 AM as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting all of this together, we know that Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 02:00 AM  and 03:00 AM, and that must mean that she killed Mr. Boddy in the room she was in at 01:00 AM, the Carriage House.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Since the Revolver was in the Kitchen at 03:00 AM and in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at the same moment, the murder weapon used must be the Revolver.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. From the clue \"The murderer moved the Horseshoe from the Dining Room to the Drawing Room at 03:00 AM\", we know that the suspect killed Mr. Boddy in a room other than the Drawing Room at 03:00 AM. From the clue that \"Mr. Boddy was in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM or the murder weapon was in the Courtyard at 01:00 AM\" and the clue \"Mr. Boddy was murdered at 01:00 AM,\" we can conclude that Mr. Boddy was in the Dining Room at 12:00 AM. The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Carriage House at 02:00 AM, because the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Carriage House at 02:00 AM, not the suspect motivated by Hatred. So, it must be one of the other suspects in the Carriage House at 02:00 AM. Since the other suspects in the Carriage House at 02:00 AM cannot have been the ones to have committed the murder (the suspects in the Carriage House at 02:00 AM are Mrs. Peacock, Miss Peach, and the suspect motivated by Fear), Mrs. Peacock was the one that murdered Mr. Boddy and the room she was in cannot be the Carriage House at 02:00 AM, which means the room she was in must be the one her husband was in at 01:00 AM. Since it was 01:00 AM during the murder and Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen at 01:00 AM, that must be the room she was in during the murder, and thus the room she was in was the Kitchen, and since the murder weapon must have been there during the murder, the room was the Kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. From the clue \"Mrs. Peacock was in the same room as Professor Plum at 09:00 PM\" and the clue \"Mr. Boddy was in the same room as Sgt. Gray at 09:00 PM \", we know that Mrs. Peacock was not in the Kitchen at 09:00 PM because Sgt. Gray would have to be the person with an unallocated motive at that time, which we know from the clue that \"The suspect motivated by Betrayal moved from the Study to the Kitchen at 12:00 AM\" cannot be (because the killer is the person with the motive that was present at the Murder time), that there must be a mistake in that clue. Assuming there was error in previous explanations, because we know that  \"The suspect motivated by Anger was in the Library at 03:00 AM\", which means that Mrs. Peacock was the person that moved the Revolver in this case.\n",
      "From the clue \"The suspect motivated by Power moved from the Library to the Cloak Room at 10:00 PM\", we know that the person with the Power motive was in the Library at 10:00 PM and the person with the Power motive was in the Cloak Room at 02:00 AM (the suspect motivated by Power must have moved to the same room as the Wrench at 01:00 AM). From the clue that \"The suspect motivated by Jealousy moved from the Dining Room to the Library at 10:00 PM\", we know that Mr. Boddy's position must be the Dining Room at 10:00 PM or the person with the jealousy motive moved to the Library.\n",
      "Since we already know that the murder must have happened in the Kitchen, and we also know that the person with the Power motive must have been in the Library and in the same room with the Wrench at 01:00 AM, we can conclude that the person with Power must have been in the Library at 09:00 PM.\n",
      "However, this is a contradictory with the clue that \"Mr. Boddy was in the Dining Room at 01:00 AM if or the Lead Pipe was in the Billiard Room at 01:00 AM\" which can be combined with the clue \"The Lead Pipe was in the Studio at 01:00 AM\", which means Mr. Boddy was in the Dining Room at 01:00 AM. However the person with the Power motive was in the Library at 09:00 PM, so the person with Power was also present in the Library at 01:00 AM. This leads to a contradiction because the suspect motivated by Power moved to the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM and the Lead Pipe was in the Studio at 01:00 AM. Therefore, this is another incorrect step in the reasoning above.\n",
      "However, considering the previous assumption of error in the clue \"The suspect motivated by Betrayal moved from the Study to the Kitchen at 12:00 AM\" is incorrect, we can check all the possibilities.\n",
      "Given that the suspect motivated by Power, was in the Library at 01:00 AM, because the suspect with the Power motive was in the Library at 10:00 PM and moved to the same room with the Wrench, which is the Hall at 01:00 AM, we can see that all the previous steps of the reasoning contain errors. \n",
      "Now let's correct all the steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, from the clue that \"Colonel Mustard was in the Trophy Room at 02:00 AM, if and only if the Madame Rose was in the Courtyard at 09:00 PM\"  we know that the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Trophy Room at 02:00 AM (the suspects that were in\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "{'A': 'Madame Rose', 'B': 'Billiard Room', 'C': '12:00 AM', 'D': 'Ambition', 'E': 'Ballroom', 'F': 'Colonel Mustard', 'G': 'Gazebo', 'H': None} \n",
      "Response:\n",
      "From the given set of clues, let's infer the possible locations of Madame Rose and the Lead Pipe. Given the phrase \"The Rope was in the Carriage House at 10:30 PM if and only if the Lead Pipe was in the Lounge at 12:30 AM,\" if the Rope wasn't in the Carriage House at 10:30 PM, then it implies the Lead Pipe was not in the Lounge at 12:30 AM. However, since \"The murder weapon and Mr. Green were in the Lounge together at least once\" and the murder weapon is known to be the Revolver, it would mean the Lead Pipe wasn't in the Lounge at 12:30 AM. But we have \"Mr. Boddy was in the Lounge at 11:00 PM\" and \"Mr. Boddy was in the room just west of the Revolver at 11:30 PM\" so Mr. Boddy, the Lead Pipe, and the Revolver cannot be in the Lounge at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of such, from the first clue, it is deduced that the Rope and the Lead Pipe are both in the Carriage House at 10:30 PM. Thus, the Lead Pipe was in the Lounge at some point, but it wasn't at 12:30 AM, so it must have moved there from somewhere else. \"The Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM\" so Mr. Boddy must have moved the Lead Pipe to the Lounge from another room at 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM. Given that \"Mrs. White moved the Lead Pipe from the Lounge to the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM,\" and there is no other way for Mr. Boddy to move the Lead Pipe to the Lounge, and the only suspect left to be able to move the Lead Pipe in this time frame is Mrs. White.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clues \"The Rope was in the Carriage House at 10:30 PM if and only if the Lead Pipe was in the Lounge at 12:30 AM,\" \"The Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM,\" \"Mrs. White was in the room just south of the Rope at 11:00 PM,\" and \"The Rope was in the Carriage House at 10:30 PM,\" it can be concluded that the Rope is in the room just north of Mrs. White at 11:00 PM, therefore it is in the Hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lead Pipe must be in the Lounge at 12:30 AM. Given \"Mrs. White was in the room just north of the Rope at 11:00 PM,\" and \"The Rope was in the Carriage House at 10:30 PM,\" the Rope must have moved. Mrs. White must have moved the Lead Pipe to the Lounge at 11:30 PM from the room of Mr. Boddy, by moving it from the Hall to the Lounge with Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clues \"Monsieur Brunette was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM\" and \"The suspect motivated by Pride moved the Revolver from the Lounge to the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM,\" it can be determined that the suspect motivated by Pride is Monsieur Brunette. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the clue \"The suspect motivated by Power was in the Cloak Room at 12:30 AM if and only if the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Ballroom at 11:00 PM,\" and \"Madame Rose moved from the Drawing Room to the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM,\" and \"The murderer was in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM\" and \"Madame Rose and Mrs. White were not in the Billiard Room at 10:30 PM,\" the suspect motivated by Power can't be in the Cloak Room at 12:30 AM at the time of the last two clues. It must be Mrs. Peacock. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the suspect motivated by Power isn't Mrs. Peacock, then it's impossible for the suspect motivated by Greed to be in the Ballroom at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clue \"The Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM\" and \"The Lead Pipe was in the room just east of Mrs. White at 12:00 AM\", it can be determined that the Lead Pipe is in the room just south of the Lead Pipe at 12:00 AM, so it must be in the room just southwest of Mrs. White at 12:00 AM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clues \"The Knife was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 10:30 PM,\" and \"The Knife was in the Carriage House at 11:00 PM or Mr. Boddy was at the Fountain at 10:30 PM,\" it can be determined that the Knife was in the Carriage House at 10:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue \"Madame Rose moved the Revolver from the Billiard Room to the Lounge at 12:30 AM\" \"The Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM\" and \"The Lead Pipe was in the Lounge at 12:30 AM\" can be used to determine that Mr. Boddy was killed between 11:00 PM and 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that \"The Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM\" and \"The Knife was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 10:30 PM\" implies that the murder must have taken place at 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the murderer was in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM and Mr. Boddy was in the Lounge at 11:00 PM and Mr. Boddy was in the room just west of the Revolver, it must be that Mr. Boddy moved the Lead Pipe from his location to the Lounge, but given \"Mrs. White moved the Lead Pipe from the Lounge to the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM\" and \"The Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM,\" it means that Mrs. White moved the Lead Pipe which means she must be in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM and the murderer must be in the Lounge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it is given \"The Lead Pipe was in the room just southwest of Mrs. White at 12:00 AM,\" it can be determined that Mr. Boddy, who is in the Lounge at 11:00 PM, was in the room just northwest of Mrs. White at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it's given that \"The suspect motivated by Anger was in the Dining Room at 10:30 PM,\" the only room available is 03. Additionally, \"Mrs. Peacock was in the room just north of Madame Rose at 10:30 PM,\" so Madame Rose is in room 11 and Mrs. Peacock is in room 09.\n",

      "Response:\n",
      "To solve the mystery, let's analyze the given clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Since Mr. Boddy was killed with the Knife, the killer must not be the person who moved the Knife. Since Mr. Boddy was in the room just north of the Revolver at 11:45 PM, the killer and the person with the Knife must have moved to a room other than the one with the Revolver. We can eliminate the Dining Room, since we know Mr. Boddy was there with Mr. Green at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the killer must be the person who was in the room with the knife at 11:45 PM, and knowing that Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) was in the room just north of the Revolver, we can assume the room with the Revolver must either be the Billiard Room or the room corresponding to number 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Billiard Room were the room with the Revolver, Miss Scarlet (who was in the room just north of the Knife) would have to take the knife to the room corresponding to number 2, which is the Dining Room. However, if the Billiard Room were the room with the Knife, the killer (who had to be in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM) would have to have moved the knife to the Dining Room at some point, which would put the killer and Mr. Boddy in the same room. We know this didn't happen since the murder didn't occur in the room with the Revolver. Since Mr. Boddy was in the room just north of the Revolver at 11:45 PM, and cannot be in the Dining Room, then Mr. Boddy must be in room 2 at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the room with the Knife must be the room corresponding to 1, since it could not be in the dining room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the killer was in room 1 at 11:45 PM, and room 2 must have either been the Billiard Room or the Dining Room.  Since the setup was North - Billiards West 1 East South - West 2 East South (1 and 2 already used as north and south descriptions), if the Billiard Room were the room with the Revolver then it would have to be in room 1, which would place Mr. Boddy in the room with the Knife (1) and in the Dining Room with Mr. Green, which conflicts with the given clue that Mr. Boddy was in the room just north of the Revolver, and so must be the room with the Dining Room being the north room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, if one of the given times were 11:45 PM, we know Mr. Boddy was in room 2 at that time, and the other must be the time when the killer is in room 1. This means the room with the Knife was room 1 and at 11:45 PM it would belong to Miss Scarlet, who was previously in the room just north of the Knife. Since the billiard room must be the north room, then the killer must be the person who switched from the Billiards at 11:45 PM and stayed in the room. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also know that Mr. Boddy was in the room just north of the Revolver, and cannot be in the Dining Room. Thus the killer could not be Mr. Green, who was with Mr. Boddy in the Dining Room at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "We already know Miss Scarlet was in the room just north of the Knife, Mr. Boddy was killed with the Knife, and the murderer was one of the two rooms corresponding to the number 1 or 2.  Since Mr. Boddy was in the room just north of the Revolver, the killer cannot be in the dining room at 11:45 PM. This would only be possible if Mr. Boddy were already dead. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Mr. Boddy must have been in room 2 at 11:45 PM. This means the murder must have occurred at 12:00 AM, which also corresponds to the given fact that Mr. Boddy was killed with the Knife (the killer was always in the Billiards). The killer could not stay in the billiard room at both 11:45 and 12:00 AM because Miss Scarlet was with Mr. Green at one of these times, which must be 11:45 PM, otherwise, Miss Scarlet would have been in the Billiard room at 12:00 AM, which means the killer was in the Dining Room, which is not possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, at 11:45 PM, Miss Scarlet was in the Billiard room (the room corresponding to number 1), Mr. Boddy was in the Dining room, Mr. Boddy was killed with the Knife at 12:00 AM (meaning the room with the knife had to be the Dining room at 11:45 PM). \n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the killer must be in the Billiard room at 12:00 AM. Since Miss Scarlet was in the Billiard room at 11:45 PM, the murderer is Mr. Green motivated by Greed.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "- Based on the clues, Colonel Mustard was in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM (from the 14th clue) and the murderer was in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM (from the 17th clue). Since the only suspect motivated by Betrayal who could be in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM is the one in the conservatory, the suspect motivated by Betrayal must be in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM, meaning that the suspect motivated by Betrayal is indeed in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM. Since the suspect motivated by Betrayal could be either in the Conservatory or the Gazebo at 12:00 AM (from the 12th clue), the suspect motivated by Betrayal must be in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM. Since the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Dining Room at 11:00 PM (from the 1st clue), the suspect motivated by Greed was not in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM. So, the only possibility is that the suspect motivated by Betrayal is Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "- According to the 5th clue, Mr. Boddy was in the room just west of the Poison at 11:00 PM. Since the Poison was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM (from the 14th clue), the room just west of it at 11:00 PM must be the Study. Mr. Boddy was in the Study at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Since Mr. Boddy was in the Study at 11:00 PM, and Madame Rose was in the Library at 11:00 PM (from the 9th clue), and Madame Rose was in the Study at 12:00 AM (from the 9th clue), Madame Rose must have moved from the Library to the Study at 12:00 AM, but she was originally in the Library at 11:00 PM (from the 9th clue). Since Madame Rose was not in the Study at 11:00 PM and was in the Library, Madame Rose can't be in the Study at 11:00 PM. The suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM must be the one who was in the same room as the Lead Pipe at the Fountain at 12:00 AM (from the 16th clue), which is the one who moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM (from the 13th clue). The suspect who moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM must be in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM, and the suspect who was in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM must have been in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM (from the 6th clue) if and only if Mrs. White was in the Room just east of the Candlestick at 11:00 PM. The suspect who was in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM must have moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM, meaning they can't be in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM. Therefore, the suspect who was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM must be the one who moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM. The suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM and moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM must have been in the Study at 11:00 PM if and only if Monsieur Brunette was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM. Monsieur Brunette was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM if and only if Mrs. White was in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM (from the 11th clue), meaning the suspect who was in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM was Mrs. White since Mrs. White is motivated by Anger and Mrs. White was not in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM, the suspect who moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM must have been in the Study at 11:00 PM is not Mrs. White. The suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM must have been in the same room as the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM if and only if Mr. Boddy was murdered at 11:00 PM. The Murder could have only occurred at one of the times 11:00 PM or 12:00 AM (from the 8th clue), which means that Mr. Boddy must have been killed at 11:00 PM if there is a suspect who was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM. As a result, the suspect who was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM must be in the room just west of the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM (from the 21st clue), which is the room east of the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM, which is the room at the southeast corner. The suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM must have been in the Study at 11:00 PM if and only if the suspect who was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM was in the same room as the Rope at 12:00 AM. The Rope was at the Fountain at 12:00 AM, so the suspect who was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM must have been in the room just east of the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM, which is the Fountain. Since the suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM was in the same room as the Rope at the Fountain at 12:00 AM and the conservatory at 11:00 PM, that suspect must be at the room east of the Horseshoe at 11:00 PM. The suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM must have been in the same room as the Knife at 11:00 PM if and only if the suspect who was in the same room as the Rope at 12:00 AM was in the Hall at 11:00 PM, which the suspect who moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM is not in the Hall, so the suspect who moved from the Study to the Drawing Room was not in the Hall. The suspect who was in the room at the SE corner at 11:00 PM must have moved from the SE corner to the room at the top edge of the grid (the Drawing Room or the Study) at 12:00 AM if and only if the suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM was in the Drawing Room at 11:00 PM. But the suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM was in the same room as the Rope at the fountain at 12:00AM, which can only happen if the Rope was in the Fountain row at 12:00 AM and the suspect was in one of the rooms of the Fountain row at 11:00 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the clues and chain of reasoning above, the SE corner room must be the Fountain row at 11:00 PM and the top edge room at 12:00 AM (the Drawing Room) must be a room that was an east or west adjacent to the Fountain row. As a result, the suspect who was in the Study at 11:00 PM must have been Mrs. White, the suspect who moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room was in the Study at 12:00 AM (from the 12th clue and the 14th clue), and Mrs. White is the suspect who moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM (from the 13th clue). If and only if Mrs. White moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM and Mrs. White was in the Study at 11:00 PM, the suspect who was in the Drawing Room at 11:00 PM must be the suspect who was in the room east of the Lead Pipe at 12:00 AM if and only if the Lead Pipe was at the Fountain at 12:00 AM, which the suspect who was moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM was not in the Fountain at 12:00 AM, so the suspect who was in the room east of the Fountain must not be in the Study at 11:00 PM. Hence, Mr. Boddy was murdered at 12:00 AM.\n",

Since the Lead Pipe was in the Fountain at 12:00 AM (from the 16th clue), the suspect who moved from the Gazebo to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM was in the Fountain row.

      "From the given clues, we can determine the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Miss Scarlet was in the Dining Room (Clue 10) and was in the Trophy Room or the Lead Pipe was in the Kitchen (Clue 17)\n",
      "2. Since Miss Scarlet was in the Trophy Room and the Ballroom, that would mean the Trophy Room is in the Ballroom area. If the Lead Pipe is in the Kitchen it would mean it is in the 09, 10, or 11 area.\n",
      "3. The Horseshoe was in the Kitchen or the Lead Pipe was in the Courtyard (Clue 19). Since the Lead Pipe isn't related to the Horseshoe's location, the Horseshoe must be in the Kitchen.\n",
      "4. The Lead Pipe was in the Kitchen (From point 3), which matches two of the possible locations (09, 10, and 11).\n",
      "5. The Revolver was in the Dining Room (Clue 12) but was actually in the Lounge. \n",
      "   Therefore, since Miss Scarlet is in the Dining Room and cannot be left as stated in point 1, it can only mean the Lead Pipe is in the Courtyard. Therefore the only place left for the Lead Pipe is in location 02.\n",
      "   Hence, the Ballroom is therefore in location 01.\n",
      "6. Since the Wrench was in the room just north of the Poison (Clue 5), and the Poison was in the Trophy Room, then the Wrench must be in the Ballroom.\n",
      "7. Since the suspect motivated by Power was in the Cloak Room, then Professor Plum must be in the Cloak Room. This means that location 04 is the Cloak Room.\n",
      "8. The Rope was in the Studio (Clue 8) hence location 13 is the Studio.\n",
      "9. Mrs. White was in the Ballroom (Clue 16), which is location 01.\n",
      "10. Sgt. Gray was in the room just east of Mrs. White. As Mrs. White was in the Ballroom and is in the north-west corner, the room just east is the south-west corner, which is location 12.\n",
      "11. Since Miss Scarlet and the Murder must have been in the same room with at least one weapon. And Miss Scarlet must be in the Dining Room (Clue 10) and there is also a Revolver in the Dining Room (Clue 12) then the murder must have been committed in the Dining Room.\n",
      "12.  The suspect motivated by Betrayal is Colonel Mustard and this is in the Library. \n",
      "13. If the murder was committed in the Billiard Room (01), then the Horseshoe was in the Kitchen and this matches the conditions. \n",
      "14. As Madam Rose is motivated by Revenge and the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Library (Clue 19), and since Madam Rose was in the Dining Room (Clue 15), then the suspect motivated by Anger must be in the Conservatory or the Fountain. This isn't possible, so the murderer must have been in the Billiard Room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus with Miss Scarlet, Madame Rose and Colonel Mustard in the same room with a weapon (the Revolver or the Revolver, the Horseshoe and the Knife), Miss Scarlet's motive of greed and Madam Rose's motive for revenge mean that Miss Scarlet must be the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence the Final answers will be as stated above.\n",

      "- Mr. Boddy was found dead in one of the rooms of Tudor Mansion, which we now know are the Dining Room (2) or the Kitchen (1). And because the killer must be alone with the Wrench (the murder weapon), the killer must be in the room with the Wrench (2), not in the kitchen (1).\n",
      "- We know that Mr. Boddy was killed with the Wrench, therefore the killer is Miss Scarlet (A) - room 2 (B) - since we know that's the room with the Wrench. The room with the Lead Pipe must be the Kitchen, since room 2 has the Wrench.\n",
      "- Reasons for murder are either Fear or Pride. We know Colonel Mustard has Pride as his motive. So we can conclude that Miss Scarlet's motive must be Fear (C). \n",

      "- Out of all the remaining options, the person with the wrench is now known, so the person in the Kitchen must be the one motivated by Fear (D).\n",

      "Using Professor Plum's position at 11:45 PM, and the fact that the Horseshoe was then in the same room as Professor Plum, we can deduce that the Horseshoe was in one of the rooms (3,N, or 9), since we already know the 0 row and 1 row has no H's or P's.\n",

      "Since the suspect motivated by Hatred had the Rope, we would be able to directly locate this person, then knowing that the Rope was in the room just east of Mr. Boddy, giving us the available rooms for Mr. Boddy as (F, or 1). But Prof. Plum has to be in the room that is just north of the Horseshoe at 11:45 PM, making the available rooms for Professor Plum as (3, 8, or 2). The only room north of both room (3, 8, and 2) in the grid that could accommodate the suggestion that Professor Plum says \"I am north of the Horseshoe\" is room 3.\n",

      "\n",
      "Using the clues \"The suspect motivated by Greed moved from the Conservatory to the Library at 12:30 AM\", the suspect motivated by Greed must have been the one who moved to the Library at 12:30 AM, so the initial position of the suspect motivated by Greed should be the Conservatory. Since we are trying to find Mr. Boddy, this provides us only one option, so Mr. Boddy's position at 11:45 PM could be the Fountain or Conservatory. Since Monsieur Brunette was in the room just south of Mrs. White at 1:00 AM, the initial room of Mrs. White could not be 3 (the south of room 3 has not been visited by anyone), so both room (0) is ruled out by this. Also, since Prof. Plum was in room 3, we could exclude room 3 as well.\n",

Therefore, the Revolver must be in the Studio at 12:00 AM. As Colonel Mustard was in the Studio at 12:00 AM, the Revolver must be in the Studio at 12:00 AM.

      "G. Hatred (for Madame Rose, she was the one motivated by Hatred, but the question asks about what motivates her, not who she is)\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Mr. Boddy was murdered at 12:30 AM and the murderer moved from the Library to the Ballroom at 12:15 AM, the murderer must have been in the Library at 12:15 AM. So the murderer could be \n",
      "\n",
      "   - Colonel Mustard (moved from the Kitchen to the Fountain at 12:00 AM, and was in the same room with Mr. Green at 12:45 AM)\n",
      "   - Mrs. White (in the same row as the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM, was in a room where a weapon was at 12:30 AM and the murder weapon was moved to the Trophy Room at 12:45 AM)\n",
      "   - Miss Scarlet (moved from the Trophy Room to the Kitchen at 12:30 AM)\n",
      "   - Mrs. Peacock (was in the same room as Miss Peach at 12:30 AM)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Horseshoe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM, and it is in the same room as the Rope and the Wrench at least once, only Mrs. White could be the one with the Horseshoe. Also, Mrs. White moved the Horseshoe from the Ballroom to the Trophy Room at 12:45 AM, which means she was the one with the Ballroom. Since we know the murder weapon was in the Ballroom at 12:30 AM, we can deduce that the murder weapon was the Wrench.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the rest of the options, we can eliminate Mrs. Peacock because the image description says that she was in the same room as Mrs. White at 12:00 AM, but the same row. Since the room where the Horseshoe was is equidistant from one of the solutions, Mrs. Peacock cannot be the person in the same row with the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we can also eliminate the case where Mrs. White and Mrs. Peacock are the same. Mrs. White was in the room just north of the Horseshoe and was in the room where the murder weapon was moved to the Trophy Room. So, she cannot be the one motivated by Anger, or else she would have been in the room which the Horseshoe is in at 12:00 AM. We know that the suspect motivated by Revenge moved from the kitchen to the Fountain at 12:00 AM and Mr. Boddy moved to the ballroom at 12:15 AM. Therefore, the suspect with Anger, Betrayal, Greed, or Power stayed in the ballroom from 12:15-12:30. Madame Rose moved from the Gazebo to the ballroom at 12:45 AM if the Horseshoe was in the Ballroom at 12:15 AM, but she is not the one in the same room as the Wrench and Horseshoe at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Horseshoe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy, the Horseshoe must have been moved from the Ballroom to the Library at 12:15 AM, which means Mrs. White could only move the Wrench to the Ballroom at 12:45 AM. This also means she is not the one with the Power motivation as the Power motivation stayed in the Fountain at 12:00 AM (as the Power motivation and Mr. Green were at the Fountain together at 12:00 AM) and Power stayed in the Fountain until 12:15 AM and then moved to the Ballroom at 12:15 AM. Since she has no connection to the Power motivation and in the same row with the Horseshoe, she must be motivated by Revenge or Hatred. Now considering all of the clues, we can conclude that Mrs. White moved from the Gazebo to the Library at 12:00 AM (because no one else moved to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM), and the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM (because Mrs. White stayed in the library at 12:00 AM). Thus, Mrs. White could not be the one with Anger, Betrayal, Greed, or Power. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Mrs. White could have only moved the Wrench, she could not be the one with the Horseshoe, the Rope, or the Knife (the Rope and Wrench were moved together). As the Wrench was moved from the Ballroom, and Wrench was found at 12:45 AM, Mrs. White could not be the one with the Revolver. Given all the remaining options, we know Mrs. White is the only one who could be the one with the Wrench.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we can find out which room the murder occurred in. Given the fact that the suspect motivated by Betrayal moved from the Gazebo to the Billiard Room at 12:15 AM, and since murder occurred at 12:30 AM, it must be either Revenge or Power that moved to the Trophy Room at 12:45 AM. We also know that the murder weapon was moved from the Ballroom to the Trophy Room, which means the Ballroom is not the place of the murder. Since Miss Peach was in the room with Mr. Green at 11:45 PM, and Mrs. Peacock moved from a room that is in the same column with the room where the Horseshoe was at 12:00 AM, and the room where the Horseshoe was at 12:00 AM is either the ballroom or kitchen, at 12:00 AM, the options where the murder could have occurred are either the Ballroom or the Kitchen. The only option left that could be the place of the murder is the Kitchen.\n",

      "3. The suspect motivated by Jealousy moved from the Studio to the Library at 11:00 PM, and the suspect motivated by Revenge moved from the Studio to the Library at 11:00 PM at the same time. Since Miss Peach was in the Studio at 10:30 PM, she could not have been the one to move from the Studio to the Library. So, the only possible person who could be motivated by Jealousy was in the Studio at 10:30 PM was Madame Rose.\n",
      "4. Mr. Boddy was in the Library at 11:30 PM, and since Colonel Mustard was in the Library at 11:00 PM, the Wrench must be in the Library at 10:30 PM (but it could be in another room at 11:00 PM and 11:30 PM).

      "2. The murder weapon was in the same room as Mr. Green at 11:30 PM:\n",

      "3. The Knife was in the room just west of Mr. Green at 12:00 AM:\n",

      "4. The Rope was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM if and only if the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM:\n",
      "- Since the Trophy Room has the Knife at 11:30 PM (from 2.), the Rope was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM (because only the suspect motivated by Fear has the knife at 11:30 PM and the suspect motivated by Power had it at 11:30 PM).\n",

      "5. The Knife was at the Fountain at 12:00 AM if and only if the suspect motivated by Fear was at the Fountain at 11:30 PM:\n",

      "6. The murder weapon and Mr. Green were in the Trophy Room together at least once:\n",

Gray is in the Conservatory.\n",
      "- At 09:00 PM: A suspect motivated by Ambition moves the Candlestick from the Courtyard to the Conservatory, a suspect motivated by Ambition moves from the Conservatory to the Courtyard, A suspect motivated by Fear is in the Courtyard, A suspect motivated by Betrayal moved the Poison from the Drawing Room to the Study, a suspect motivated by Betrayal moved from the Trophy Room to the Study, the Poison is in the Trophy Room, Colonel Mustard was in the room just north of the Candlestick, Professor Plum is at the Fountain, Mrs. Peacock is at the Fountain, and Monsieur Brunette is in the room east of the Poison.\n",
      "- At 11:00 PM: The Knife was in the Hall at 11:00 PM if and only if Mr. Boddy was in the Hall at 11:00 PM (by use of the second clue), The Knife was in the room just north of Professor Plum at 01:00 AM, Colonel Mustard moved the murder weapon from the Carriage House to the Hall, Sgt. Gray was in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM, The Knife was in the Conservatory at 01:00 AM, The Knife was in the Hall at 09:00 PM, and The Knife was in the Drawing Room at 08:00 PM (this suggests that the murder occurred at 11:00 PM).\n",
      "- At 11:00 PM, if you go against the logic (showing what can't happen), the killers could only have been people in the Hall because otherwise, the suspects can't have stayed in the same rooms they were at 10:00 PM. This suggests one suspect cannot stay in the room they were in 10 minutes before because either place would not be wholly free of weapons and they cannot both share a room with weapons with the same 2 suspects. Only Colonel Mustard could have moved the weapon from the Carriage House to the Hall and Mr. Boddy and Colonel Mustard must have been in the Hall together later. If Mr. Boddy was in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM and Professor Plum is at the Fountain at 09:00 PM, he must've been in the Fountain at 08:00 PM. The suspects Ambition, Betrayal, and Fear can't both be in the room at the same time Mr. Boddy is in the Conservatory or Hall for them to have gotten the weapons to be with them.\n",
      "- At 10:00 PM: The reason Professor Plum and Mr. Boddy were in the Fountain can be removed and in the same room at 08:00 PM at the Fountain, at this amount of time, Fear has to be in the Courtyard to stay in the room with the Lead Pipe. It is clear that there is a suspect Ambition who is also in the Courtyard at the same time. Since the Professor Plum and Mr. Boddy were in the Fountain, and the Poison was at the Drawing Room, only a suspect motivated by Fear would have enough motivation to move to the Drawing room after moving the Poison from it because the person would be desperate to get out of the drawing room. Fear doesn't want to be there, they want to be in the Hall (with Mr. Boddy at the time).\n",
      "- Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) and Professor Plum were at the Fountain together and we do not yet have a scenario where Professor Plum is in the Fountain with the Poison at 09:00 PM or 08:00 PM (since we know he's at the Fountain with Mr. Boddy at 08:00 PM). Therefore,  we can conclude that Mr. Boddy and Professor Plum must have been at the Fountain at 11:00 PM, and started at the Fountain at 10:00 PM. Therefore, Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) and Professor Plum must have been in the drawing room also at 11:00 PM when the poison was in the Trophy Room. Therefore, at 09:00 PM the suspects must still be in the rooms they were at 08:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining these results, the only option that can work is that Professor Plum killed Mr. Boddy at 11:00 PM in the Room where the Lead Pipe is (Fountain) using it.

      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the location of the suspect motivated by Betrayal, Sergeant Gray, we use the fact that the murder weapon is the Lead Pipe (which is found at the Fountain), and Sergeant Gray was in the Conservatory. Therefore, the remaining suspects and motives are: Colonel Mustard (Hatred), Monsieur Brunette (Pride), Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum (Power), Miss Scarlet (Anger), Mr. Green (Fear), Mrs. White (Ambition), and Mr. Greed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the Lead Pipe is at the Fountain, we can deduce that the murder occurred at the Fountain, since one of the relative positions of the Lead Pipe would be under the Fountain. Since the murder could only have occurred in one of two rooms, we look at the relative positions of the available rooms. Only the Billiard Room and the Fountain can be placed in the Fountain's relative position. But if the Billiard Room were in the Fountain's position, then the Lead Pipe could not be in the Billiard Room. Hence, the murder occurred at the Fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that Sergeant Gray is motivated by Betrayal and the Lead Pipe was the murder weapon, we can narrow down the remaining options for suspects and motives. The room the murderer is in is either the Fountain, the Library, or the Cloak Room. However, since Sergeant Gray was at the Conservatory, we can rule out the Library and Cloak Room, since the suspects solely in those rooms would be a subset of the suspects solely in the Billiard Room, Gazebo, and Conservatory. Since the remaining suspects and motives are exclusively in the rooms below the middle row, Sergeant Gray must be in the Billiard Room. However, the Knife is in the Billiard Room if and only if the Candlestick is in the Billiard Room. Hence, the Candlestick cannot be in the Billiard Room. This forces Sergeant Gray to be in the room above the Billiard Room, which is the Gazebo or the Fountain. As Sergeant Gray could not be in the Gazebo (since then the Horseshoe would not be in the same room as Sergeant Gray), he must be at the Fountain. We can then conclude that the murder occurred at the Fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Miss Scarlet is in the room just south of Monsieur Brunette, she must be in the Hall, since Monsieur Brunette has to be in the room with the Horseshoe - the Billiard Room.\n",

      "Professor Plum was in the Library or in the Dining Room. Since Miss Scarlet was at the Fountain and the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Dining Room, and Miss Scarlet was at the Fountain if and only if Mrs. White was in the Conservatory, Professor Plum was in the Library.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Hatred was Colonel Mustard. He can't be in the room with the Poison. Since the suspect motivated by Revenge is in the Cloak Room, Mrs. Peacock can't be in the Cloak Room. Thus, Colonel Mustard was not in the Cloak Room, but in the Billiard Room, Gazebo, or Library.\n",

      "Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Dining Room or the Trophy Room, the suspect motivated by Fear, Mrs. White, must be either in the Hall or the Gazebo. If the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Gazebo, then the Gazebo would contain the Candlestick and the suspect motivated by Ambition would be in the Billiard Room. Therefore, the suspect motivated by Fear must be in the Hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mr. Green was in the Conservatory or Miss Scarlet was at the Fountain, Mr. Green was either in the Conservatory or the library. If Mr. Green were in the Library, the suspect motivated by Power, Professor Plum, would be in a different room. Therefore, Mr. Green is in the Conservatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since one of the Killer and Mr. Boddy was in the room with the Lead Pipe, they could not be in the room above it, because that room is under the preceding two rooms. Therefore, Mr. Boddy was in the Ballroom. But since the Lead Pipe was in the Fountain, the Ballroom must be under it. However, this is impossible, so the Ballroom must not be under the Fountain. Since the relative positions of the rooms would put some rooms under the Fountain, the murder must have occurred above the Fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the murderer was either in the Cloak Room or the Library, and in every room above the Fountain there are two options, we can eliminate the options where the suspect motivated by Fear or the suspect motivated by Power was in the rooms above the Fountain. Since the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Hall and the suspect motivated by Power was Professor Plum in the Library, the murderer must either be in the Billiard Room or the Gazebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the Billiard Room has a Knife and the Gazebo has a Candlestick, and the lead pipe was in the Fountain, we can rule out the Billiard Room as a possible location for the Killer. Given the Horseshoe is in the Billiard Room, the suspect motivated by Revenge (Mis Scarlet) can't be in the Billiard Room, because then the Horseshoe would be in the same room as the revenge motive, which was impossible.\n",

      "• From the clue \"The candlestick was in the same room as Sgt. Gray at 11:30 PM\", and the candlestick being in the Hall at 12:30 AM, Sgt. Gray must have moved through the room 3 times, moving from the Hall to the Conservatory to the Hall to the very last room with Mr. Boddy. \n",
      "\n",
      "• The clue \"The suspect motivated by Fear moved from the Studio to the Dining Room at 12:30 AM\" either means that the suspect motivated by Fear was at the Studio at 12:30 AM or was in the Studio earlier. Since both possibilities are now ruled out, the suspect motivated by Fear was not in the Studio at any point this night.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Since Mr. Boddy stayed in the same room from 11:30 PM to 12:00 AM, and the suspect motivated by Fear can only have moved through the rooms 2 and 5, Mrs. White did not kill Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspect motivated by Anger was in the Hall at 12:00 AM, so the suspect motivated by Greed was in the room just south of the Hall. The room just south of the Hall at the 12 AM frame is the room 3, which leaves Sgt. Gray and Mrs. White both out, as they both resided in the room 1. \n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspect motivated by Greed was in room 3 at 11:30 PM and in the room just south of the Hall at 12:00 AM, which makes it room 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "• From the clue \"The suspect motivated by Greed moved from the Fountain to the room 4 (the room just south of the Hall) at 11:30 PM\", the Fountain should have been room 5, which makes the suspect motivated by Greed Colonel Mustard. The suspect motivated by Fear was then in the Studio at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspect motivated by Greed was in the Studio and Mrs. White was in the room just north of Colonel Mustard at 12:30 AM, so she cannot be in the Studio at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Since Sgt. Gray was in the room just south of the Studio at 12:30 AM, the Studio is the room to the East at the 12:00 AM frame, which leaves the room 5 to be the Conservatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspect motivated by Anger moved from the Conservatory to the Fountain at 12:00 AM, and since the Fountain is also room 5, then the suspect motivated by Anger was at the Conservatory at 11:30 PM and thus in the Fountain at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspect motivated by Anger was at the Fountain and the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the same room as the murderer. So the suspect with Ambition was the murderer. Also, the suspect with Anger could not have moved the poison from the Fountain to the Studio at 12:30 AM, so Mrs. White was at the Studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Mrs. White is ruled out, Additionally, Mrs. Peacock was at the Fountain at 12:30 AM and the Fountain was the room that Mr. Boddy was in at 11:30 PM, so the murderer moved from the Fountain to the Hall and then remained there due to Sgt. Gray.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The Studio was the room the worried suspect was in, and Mrs. White was not there at 12:30 AM, so the suspect who moved through the room 4 is in the Studio. \n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspect who moved through the room 4 was also the suspect who was in the room above the Wrench and Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM, which means Sgt. Gray was in the Studio at 12:00 AM and was ruled out.\n",
      "\n",
      "• So, the suspect in the Studio at 12:30 AM was Colonel Mustard, but Mrs. White was in the room north of Colonel Mustard at 12:30 AM. This is impossible as they could not both be in the same set of rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Mrs. White was not the student in the Studio, then the suspect who moved through the room 4 was actually Mrs. White, and so we can plug this value in for our Solver below:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Mrs. White was at the fountain at 11:30, so she cannot be the one who was at the Hall at the 11:30 frame, eliminating Mrs. White.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Mr. Boddy was in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM and the room the suspect was in at the 11:30 frame. \n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspect in the room 4 at the 11:30 frame, had to be in the room the suspect with the lead was in, so the suspect with the lead pipe was in the room 5 at the 12:00 AM timeframe, but since we have already ruled out the suggestion that the Hall was the case, we can rule out the Hall as the room 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "• As the Studio is not room 5, the suspect motivated by Greed was in the room just south of the Wrench at 11:30 PM. The room just south of the Wrench at the 11:30 frame is the room 3, but the suspect with the Wrench was already seen to be in the room 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "• This means the suspect with the Wrench was the suspect in the room above it at the 11:30, so Mr. Boddy was at the room 3 at the 11:30 PM frame. \n",
      "\n",
      "• Mrs. White was at the room above the room 3 at 12:00 AM. Therefore, the suspect motivated by Fear was in the room above the room 3 at the 12:00 AM frame, but this is impossible as the room above the room 3 at this frame is the Studio, and Mrs. White was at the room 3 at the 11:30 frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspect motivated by Fear was at the room south of Mr. Boddy at 11:30, which must be room 4, and the suspect with the Wrench was in Mr. Boddy's room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The suspects motivated by Anger, Ambition, and Greed were ruled to be in the rooms 1, 3, and 4, respectively. The suspect with the wrench could not have been in any of these rooms, which means the suspect with the wrench was actually Mrs. White.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Now, all that remains is to narrow down the remaining suspects. Mrs. Peacock was in the room below the suspect motivated by Anger at 12:00 PM, and the room below at this time can only be the room 4 because if it were room 3, then Mrs. Peacock would have to be in the room below room 1, which cannot be possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Since Mrs. Peacock was in the room below the suspect with ambition, this must have been at the 12:00 PM time frame at the room 5 and the room below the room 5 can only be the room 4 at this frame, which would then mean the suspect motivated by ambition was not the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "• This implies that the suspects eliminated by this clue were Mrs. Peacock and the Murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Mrs. Peacock was at the Fountain at 12:30 AM, which means we could use Mrs. Peacock to determine the murderer.\n",

Since the Wrench and Mr. Boddy must have been in the same room, and the Wrench is in ROOM 2, Mr. Boddy was also in ROOM 2. Since Miss Peach must have been alone with the Knife (and the murder could only occur in a room with at least one weapon), she must have been in ROOM 1 with the Knife. The Studio is connected with ROOM 1 via the South and the Lounge is connected to both ROOM 1 and ROOM 2 via the West or East. The North is connected to ROOM 1 and ROOM 2, but since Madame Rose is in the room with the Wrench, and Mr. Boddy and the Wrench must have been in the same room, Madame Rose must be in ROOM 2, and therefore ROOM 2 is the Lounge.

      "- From clue 14, at 11:00 PM, the Rope was at the Fountain. From clue 31, for the Rope to be at the Fountain at 11:00 PM, Mr. Boddy must have been in the Lounge at 11:00 PM. Since Professor Plum was at the Fountain at 11:00 PM, the Colonel Mustard and Professor Plum must have been at different rooms at 11:00 PM. From clue 11, Mr. Boddy was in the room just west of Mrs. White at 12:00 AM, which means that Mrs. White must be at the room just east of Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM. From clue 9, this means that Mrs. White must be in the room 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 or 9  at 12:00 AM. At 12:00 AM, Colonel Mustard was at the same room as Professor Plum, which is the room 5 or 7 (because Professor Plum was at the Fountain, which is room 7). At 12:00 AM, Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard must be in different rooms, so they must be in the rooms 5 and 7. However, from clue 29, at 01:00 AM, the Rope must be at the Conservatory. From clue 17, the suspect motivated by Revenge must have been at the Fountain at 12:00 AM. So, at 12:00 AM, Professor Plum must be in the Fountain and the Colonel Mustard must be in the room 5. From clues 9 and 12, Mrs. White must be at the room just east of the room where Mr. Boddy was at 11:00 PM, which is the room 2, which is the room where Colonel Mustard is at 12:00 AM. However, from clue 12, both Colonel Mustard and Mrs. White can't be at the same room at 12:00 AM (because they were in different rooms, Mr. Boddy would be in the room just west of Mrs. White, which would mean that Mr. Boddy was in the room 1, and the room 1 is west of the room where the Colonel Mustard is), so Mrs. White must be in the room 7, which is the room where Professor Plum is at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 20, the suspect motivated by Anger must have moved from the Fountain to the Conservatory at 12:00 AM. However, the suspect motivated by Anger must be in the room where the suspect motivated by Pride is at 01:00 AM, so at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Anger was in the room where the suspect motivated by Pride was at 11:00 PM, which is the room 5 (because the suspect motivated by Pride was at the room 5 at 11:00 PM, from clue 15). From clue 20, the suspect moved from the room 5 to the room 8 at 12:00 AM. From this, we know that the suspect motivated by Anger is in the room 8 at 12:00 AM and in the room 2 at 01:00 AM (because the suspect moved from the room 8 to the room 2 at 12:00 AM, from clue 21, the suspect motivated by Anger moved the Horseshoe from the room just east of the Lobby to the room 2 at 01:00 AM, but there's no Horseshoe in the Lobby at any point in time, so this must be a type, so the room just east of the room 2 must be the room 1, and this means the room 2 must be the room 8).\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 19, the Horseshoe was at the room 5 at 11:00 PM. From clue 17, the suspect motivated by Revenge had to have the Rope at the room 5 at 11:00 PM, which means the Rope was already at the room 5 at 11:00 PM, so the Horseshoe and the Rope must have been at the room 5 at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clues 13 and 15, the Lead Pipe was at the room 4 at 01:00 AM, and at the room 3 at 11:00 PM. At 11:00 PM, the Horseshoe must be at the room 5, so the Lead Pipe must be at the room 3 at 11:00 PM. From clue 16, the Lead Pipe must be at the room 1 at 12:00 AM. From clue 15, the Lead Pipe must be at the room 2 at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 14, Mrs. White moved to the Lobby from the Gazebo at 01:00 AM. From clue 7, the Lobby is room 6, the Lobby is room 4, the Lobby is room 5, and Mrs. White moved from the Lobby to the room 6 at 01:00 AM. From clue 16, the Lead Pipe was at the Lobby at 12:00 AM, so Mrs. White moved the Lead Pipe from the room 5 to the room 2 at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Mrs. White is not in the room 3 and the room 2 cannot be the room where Colonel Mustard is at 12:00 AM, so Mrs. White is not a suspect. From clue 28, the suspect motivated by Ambition moved from the room 7 to the room 2 at 01:00 AM, so the suspect motivated by Ambition is in the room 2 at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 10, at 11:00 PM, the Revolver was in the room just west of Mr. Green, which is the room 7. From clue 12, at 12:00 AM, Mr. Boddy was in the room just west of Mrs. White, which means he was in the room 2, so at 12:00 AM, the room just west of Mr. Green must be the room 2, which was impossible because Mr. Green is in the room 6 at 12:00 AM (from clue 25, Mr. Green was in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM, and from clue 10, the Revolver was in the room just west of Mr. Green, which is the room 7). From clue 10, the Revolver was in the room 6 at 11:00 PM, which means Mr. Green was in the room 7 at 11:00 PM (because the room 7 was the room just west of Mr. Green at 11:00 PM). However, Mr. Green cannot be in both rooms 6 and 7 at 11:00 PM (because the Revolver and the Candlestick must be in different rooms at 11:00 PM), so Mr. Green must be in the room 6 and the Candlestick must be in the room 7 at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 8, the Candlestick was in the Conservatory at 01:00 AM or the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM. So, at 01:00 AM, the Candlestick must be in the room 5 (because no room 5 at top row, room 7 is the room where Professor Plum was at 11:00 PM, room 8 is the room where the Colonel Mustard and Mrs. White are, and room 5 is the only room left), which means the Candlestick must have been in the room 7 at 12:00 AM. However, the Candlestick was in the room 7 at 11:00 PM, so the suspect motivated by Hatred must be in the room 7 at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From clue 7, the suspect motivated by Anger must have been in the room where the suspect motivated by Pride was at 01:00 AM. From clue 17, at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Anger must have moved the Rope from the room 7 to the room 2. From clue 14, Mrs. White moved the Rope from the Gazebo to the room 8 at 01:00 AM. This means that at 12:00 AM, the Rope was in the room 7 and the room 2. From clue 7, the suspect motivated by Anger must have been in the room 2 at 12:00 AM. So, at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Anger was in the room 2, but the suspect motivated by Hatred must be in the room 7 at 12:00 AM, so this will lead to a contradiction.\n",

      "Let's go back to the last two paragraphs and check our names of rooms for each time. From the previous two paragraphs, we know that (for some reason which was not fully justified here) the room 2 cannot be both room 2 and room 7 at the same time, and the room 2 cannot be room 8. So at 11:00 PM, the room 2 must be the room where Colonel Mustard is at, which is the room 1 (because the room where Colonel Mustard is at must be the room where the rope is at 12:00 AM, and the room where the rope is at 11:00 PM must be the room where Mr. Boddy was\n",

      "Here is my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clues provided, we can deduce the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- At 02:00 AM, Mr. Boddy was in the Gazebo or the murderer was in the Dining Room. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Gazebo at 02:00 AM, and we know that the Gazebo is the room of the Rope at 01:00 AM, we can conclude that the murder occurred at the Gazebo at 02:00 AM.\n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Conservatory at 08:00 PM, the Lounge at 03:00 AM, or the Carriage House at 01:00 AM. We know that Mrs. Peacock was in the Cloak Room at 03:00 AM, so the suspect motivated by Jealousy must be Mrs. Peacock.\n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Power was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 02:00 AM, the Dining Room at 09:00 PM, or the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Library at 01:00 AM, we can conclude that the suspect motivated by Power is not Mrs. Peacock.\n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Power moved from the Cloak Room to the Dining Room at 12:00 AM, which means the suspect motivated by Power was in the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM. If the suspect motivated by Power was in the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM, then the suspect motivated by Pride must be in the Courtyard at 02:00 AM.\n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Power was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 09:00 PM, but this means the suspect motivated by Power cannot be in the Dining Room at 09:00 PM, since Colonel Mustard was in the Dining Room at 09:00 PM or the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Conservatory at 08:00 PM. \n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Power was in the Library or the Cloak Room at 03:00 AM but not in the Dining Room at 09:00 PM. But the suspect motivated by Power was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 09:00 PM. So the suspect motivated by Power was in the Library at 09:00 PM. \n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Pride was in the Library at 09:00 PM or 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- From the clue Colonel Mustard was in the Gazebo at 03:00 AM or the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Lounge at 03:00 AM, Mrs. Peacock was in the Library at 01:00 AM, so the suspect motivated by Jealousy must be Mrs. Peacock at 03:00 AM, as Mrs. Peacock was in the Lounge at 03:00 AM and there was no other possible other suspect.\n",
      "- The Wrench cannot be in the same room as Professor Plum at 01:00 AM, since Mr. Boddy was in the same room as the Rope at 01:00 AM, the Wrench was in the same room as Professor Plum at 01:00 AM, and the Rope was in the Room just north of Mr. Green at 12:00 AM. Mr. Green was in the Studio at 01:00 AM and the Rope was in the room just north of Mr. Green at 01:00 AM. So the Wrench was in the Studio at 01:00 AM.\n",
      "- From the clue the suspect motivated by Power moved the Murder weapon from the Cloak Room to the Dining Room at 12:00 AM. But at 01:00 AM, the murder weapon must have been in the room of the Power Motivated Suspect, which was not yet the Dining Room.\n",
      "- Mr. Boddy was in the Gazebo at 02:00 AM or the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Studio at 03:00 AM. The suspect motivated by Hatred was not Mrs. Peacock, and the Studios location changes multiple times throughout the night, the other places that Hatred was could only have been the Gazebo or the Studio at 02:00 AM, as the Studios locations change to fitting the rest possible, and since the Wrench was in the Studio at 02:00 AM, then this place must be the Wrenchs room at 02:00 AM. So the suspect motivated by Hatred must be in the Studio at 02:00 AM.\n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Jealousy is Mrs. Peacock. The motive of the murder must be Jealousy.\n",
      "- The suspect motivated by Fear was in the Studio at 08:00 PM, the Lounge at 09:00 PM, the Drawing Room at 01:00 AM, or the Dining Room at 03:00 AM. The suspect motivated by Fear was not in the Lounge at 09:00 PM because the suspect motivated by Power was in the Library at 09:00 PM. The suspect motivated by Fear cannot be in the Drawing Room at 01:00 AM because Professor Plum was in the Drawing Room. The suspect motivated by Fear cannot be in the Studio at 08:00 PM because the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Studio at 08:00 PM. However, since Professor Plum was in the Drawing Room at 03:00 AM and the suspect motivated by Fear moved from the studio to the Dining Room at 10:00 PM, and given the information the suspect motivated by Power was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 10:00 PM, then the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Dining Room at 10:00 PM.\n",
      "- So, the suspect motivated by Fear moved to the Dining Room at 10:00 PM and moved to the Lounge at 11:00 PM and at 03:00 AM moved to the Dining Room. \n",
      "- With the information that the suspect motivated by Power was in the Dining Room 10:00 PM, and the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Cloak Room to the Dining Room at 12:00 AM, then if the suspect motivated by Power was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 02:00 AM, the suspect must have moved from the Dining Room to another room 12:00 AM. In fact, the suspect motivated by Power must be Sgt. Gray, who moved to the Carriage House at 12:00 AM and to the Gazebo at 02:00 AM, where he found Mr. Boddy and killed him.\n",
      "- Finally, from the clue that Mrs. Peacock was in the Cloak Room at 03:00 AM, the Knife must be in the Courtyard.\n",

      "Monsieur Brunette was in the Studio if and only if the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Ballroom. Since the Horseshoe is in the Ballroom, the suspect motivated by Greed cannot be in the Ballroom. Therefore, the suspect motivated by Greed could either be in the Gazebo or the Courtyard, but must not be in the Ballroom. This also means that the suspect motivated by Greed is not on the bottom row, as the Ballroom would be empty. Thus, the suspect motivated by Greed must be in the Gazebo. Therefore, Monsieur Brunette is in the Studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Professor Plum's position is not yet determined, we will come back to it later.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also know that Sgt. Gray was in the Ballroom. This means that Mrs. Peacock was either in the Courtyard, as the Knife must have been in the room where Sgt. Gray was. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Ballroom or the Knife was in the Ballroom, Mrs. Peacock must have been in the Ballroom unless Sgt. Gray is not in the Ballroom, which cannot be the case. Therefore, the Knife must be in the Courtyard. However, the Knife cannot be in the Courtyard because the Knife was in the Ballroom. \n",
      "\n",
      "The above is not correct, as Mrs. Peacock was in the Ballroom or the Knife was in the Ballroom, which also means that Mrs. Peacock cannot be in the Courtyard. So, the Knife must be in the Ballroom, as the other rooms are already occupied. If the Knife was in the Ballroom, Mrs. Peacock was in the Ballroom. However, the Ballroom is already occupied by Sgt. Gray, and Mrs. Peacock is motivated by Hatred. Therefore, Mrs. Peacock must be in the Courtyard. Since Mrs. Peacock can only be in the room that is not occupied by Sgt. Gray and the Knife was in the Ballroom, Mrs. Peacock was indeed in the Courtyard and the Knife was indeed in the Ballroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Courtyard and Sgt. Gray was in the Ballroom, since the room just south of the Rope must be Room 1, it must be the case that the Rope is in the Courtyard, which means the Rope is not in the Gazebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can conclude that the Rope is in the Courtyard, Room 4 is occupied by the Lead Pipe, the Ballroom is occupied by Sgt. Gray and the Knife, and the Knife was in the Ballroom, so the Courtyard must be occupied by Mrs. Peacock and the Rope.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can conclude that Room 3 is occupied by Monsieur Brunette. We are left with the position of Professor Plum. Since the room just west of the Lead Pipe is Room 4, Professor Plum must be in the eastmost room, Room 2.\n",

      "Thus, since Professor Plum is in the Gazebo and the Courtyard is occupied by Mrs. Peacock, we can conclude that Mrs. Peacock and Mrs. Plum are in the Courtyard and the Gazebo, respectively.\n",

      "Given that we can eliminate Mrs. Peacock and Sgt. Gray, we can now return to the fact that Monsieur Brunette was in the Studio if and only if the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Ballroom. We can conclude that Monsieur Brunette is in the Studio and the suspect motivated by Greed is in the Gazebo and is Professor Plum, as Sgt. Gray was in the Ballroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Monsieur Brunette is in the Studio, he must be in Room 3. We can eliminate the Ballroom and the Studio because we have already assigned Monsieur Brunette to the Studio. That only leaves the Gazebo and Courtyard, with the Gazebo being the only choice left since the Courtyard was already occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Professor Plum must be in the Gazebo and is motivated by Anger which is in the eastmost room, as the room where the Lead Pipe must be in the room west of Mr. Boddy's room, we can conclude that he is in the Lead Pipe room. Since the Lead Pipe is in Room 4 and Mr. Boddy must be in Room 2, Professor Plum must be in the room just west of Mr. Boddy's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can conclude that Professor Plum was in the room where the Lead Pipe can be and the motive for killing is in the room where Professor Plum is staying and where Mr. Boddy's room is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motive for the murder is in the room where Professor Plum is staying, which would be the courtyard and the remaining rooms left unclaimed are the Gazebo and Studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Gazebo has been claimed by the suspect in the Gazebo which is Professor Plum, we can now eliminate the Courtyard and Gazebo from the list and now only have the Studio left, since the Room 1 would be occupied by the rope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the correct motive for the murder must be Anger, and the murderer is Professor Plum as Anger is the motive of Professor Plum and Mr. Boddy's death happened in the courtyard and there is no evidence pointing to the killer being in any other room.\n",

      "A. SUSPECT: The suspect motivated by Revenge is in the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM, which can be deduced from the clue \"The suspect motivated by Revenge moved from the Hall to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM\" and the suspect can be identified by elimination: The suspects in the Hall at 11:45 PM are the suspect motivated by Revenge, the suspect motivated by Jealousy, and the suspect motivated by Betrayal. The suspect motivated by Jealousy moved to the Dining Room at 11:45 PM and the suspect motivated by Betrayal moved the Lead Pipe from the Cloak Room to the Fountain at 12:00 AM. Thus, the suspect motivated by Revenge must be in the Drawing Room. Since the suspect motivated by Power moved to the Carriage House at 11:45 PM, the Drawing Room can be uniquely identified by elimination of possible locations of the suspects at 11:45 PM, which are: \n",
      "The suspect motivated by Jealousy and the suspect motivated by Greed and Mr. Boddy in the Dining Room. The suspect motivated by Power is in another room (Carriage House) and the suspect motivated by Betrayal is in yet another room (Trophy Room) and also at the Fountain, which leaves the Drawing Room for the suspect motivated by Hatred and the suspect motivated by Revenge. However, the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Lounge at 11:45 PM and the Lounge was also at 11:30 PM. The suspect motivated by Revenge and Mr. Boddy moved to the room where there's at least one weapon, which is the room just east of Miss Scarlet (the Carriage House can be eliminated since the suspect motivated by Power moved there). Since the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the same room as the Lead Pipe and in the same room as Madame Rose, the suspect motivated by Revenge must use the Lead Pipe. Thus, the suspect motivated by Revenge and Mr. Boddy moved to the Lounge. Now, the suspect motivated by Hatred can be identified by elimination: the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM and the suspect motivated by Anger was killed (would bemotivated by Ambition at 11:30 PM) in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM or at 12:00 AM. As the suspect motivated by Fear and the suspects motivated by Revenge, Hatred, Anger, and Jealousy are eliminated, it must be one of the other 5 suspects (Pride, Power, Greed, Colums, and the suspect motivated by Ambition). It was established earlier that at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Power was not in the same room as the Lead Pipe, so the suspect motivated by Power was in the room with the Wrench which is the Carriage House's west neighbor. The Wrench was in the room just west of Professor Plum. However, Professor Plum is in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM, so the suspect motivated by Anger would have been in the room to the east of Professor Plum at 11:30 PM but is no longer alive at 12:00 AM. The suspect motivated by Power was in the Carriage House and cannot move into the Lounge at 11:30 PM. The suspect motivated by Pride was in the same room as the Lead Pipe and the suspect motivated by Hatred at 11:45 PM and was in the Lounge. Since the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Lounge, the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the same room as Reynold's poison (Madame Rose), therefore, the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the room where the Blue-himmed figure was in 11:45 PM which is the Lounge. Therefore, the suspect motivated by Jealousy can be eliminated by elimination. At this point, the Hanging Blue object (Poison) is in the room with the Wrench which is the Carriage House's west neighbor, yet it is said the Horseshoe was at the Fountain at 11:45 PM. We can conclude that the Carriage House's west neighbor is not the Killer and already identified earlier as Power. Now we can deduce that the suspect motivated by Power was actually either a conservative. By looking at the schedule of the suspects who moved alone, the only people that could be the suspect motivated by the button-down are the ones with time-sensitive information. for Ambition, the suspect motivated by Power was not in the same room with the Wrench at 11:30 PM but is the Wrench's neighbor. For Fear, no entire info about time for the suspect motivated by Power was given. Greed moved from the Carriage House to the Study at 12:00 AM but first moved at 11:45 PM, that cannot be true since it is said that the suspect motivated by Power and the Greed both moved to the Carriage House at 11:45 PM with a time-sensitive clue. Greed is eliminated since the Greed is not alone at 11:45 PM in the Carriage House and moved to the Study before the murder.   Pride moved to the room with the Lead Pipe at 11:45 PM. With the elimination process, Pride, Power, and the Greed can move in the following combinations of rooms: Car-Hall, CP-CH and CP-L, Ch-CH-H-B. Therefore, there are only two possible rooms for the Power candidate which are Purfect (CP and CH). The suspect motivated by Ambition moved to the same room as the murder weapon at 11:45 PM the suspect motivated by Anger, so the suspect motivated by Ambition was in the same room as the Wrench that is the Carriage House. Since Mr. Boddy was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM and the suspect motivated by Anger was either in the Ballroom at 11:30 AM or at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Anger must be killed in the Ballroom at 11:30 AM. Now we can conclude that the suspect with Ambition and Power involvement are only 2 suspects which are Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard. Now since there is still movement left (The Lead Pipe must be on the Killer, the suspect motivated by Hatred was with the Lead Pipe at 11.45 PM) the movable which are H, C, K, 3, and in the Killer's room, which can only be the suspected Lobby suspect, with the evidence that the Room boss was with Scarlet in the Carriage House at 11.45 PM. However, considering all the Blue objects that are in the Killer's room (the room's Blue objects are Juice, Pipe, and Wrench) it can be deduced that we can conclude that the Killer is Colonel Mustard. He  moved from the Cloakroom to the Study at 11:45 PM, but it was discovered earlier that he was in the Cloakroom for the last time at 11:30 PM. However, with the time-gap MPT, he could potentially be in any of the Blue objects rooms moving from 11:45 to 12:00. From the sightings as the Power and Hatred suspects, there are only two Blue influenced rooms which are the fountain and the Carriage House. This also eliminates the Suspect motivated by Jealousy in the Blue objects rooms since Jealousy moved to the Cuisine from the Conservatory at 11.45 PM of which is a sky-blue hour in 3 hall moves before  11.45, yet, it could find later join the Climatology Blue in the Fountain.

If it was 11:30 PM in the Kitchen, Miss Peach would have to be in either the Study or the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, but she cannot be in the Billiard Room because there's no room for her to be in at 11:30 PM.

But since the Candlestick is with Mr. Boddy when Professor Plum is in the Billiard Room, he can't switch with the Revolver, which implies the murder was after 11:30 PM. This also means that Miss Scarlet was in the Study at 12:00 AM, and the murderer and Mr. Boddy were in the Kitchen together at 12:00 AM. This results in Miss Scarlet being a suspect and the Candlestick being with Miss Scarlet. Given that one of the suspects was in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM if the other was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM, it means that Miss Scarlet must have been in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM and Professor Plum in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM.\n",

      "Explanation: \n",
      "\n",
      "From the clues, we know Monsieur Brunette was in the Cloak Room at 11:45 PM (or later). This means, he cannot have been in the room west of the Cloak Room at 11:45 PM (as otherwise, he would be in the room east of the Cloak Room at 11:45 PM - in which case, it follows by inference that he would have been in the Lounge at 11:45 PM and by another inference, with the revolver there, that he would be in the room west of the Lounge at 11:45 PM). If Monsieur Brunette didn't move from the Cloak Room and was in the same room at 12:00 AM, he was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hell of a contradiction?  If Monsieur Brunette was at the Cloak Room at 11:45 PM and didn't move, this suggests that Madame Rose must be in the south room (and hence not the room north of the Cloak Room at 11:45 PM) as Monsieur Brunette is dead and can't be in the south room with her. This is contradiction since, from the clues, Monsieur Brunette could have killed Mr. Boddy with the horseshoe and that he has to be in the Cloak Room at 11:45 PM - if he has moved to the room west of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, it must have been Monsieur Brunette that was in the room west of the Cloak room at 11:45 PM, of which, as we found, gives us two conflicting scenarios with neither giving Monsieur Brunette staying in the Cloak Room.\n",

      "\n",
      "The other parts of the question cannot be solved with the given information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step solution to the question:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. At 06:00 PM, Monsieur Brunette is in the Dining Room, so Mr. Boddy must be in a different room. The Gazebo and Lounge are the only options. Since Mr. Boddy was killed with the Poison and the Poison was in the Gazebo at 07:00 PM, Mr. Boddy must be in the Gazebo at 07:00 PM and the Gazebo at 07:00 PM must be the room where the murder occurred. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. At 07:00 PM, Monsieur Brunette is in the Dining Room or the Candlestick is in the Gazebo. Since the murder weapon was in the Gazebo at 07:00 PM and the murder weapon was in the Gazebo at 09:00 PM, the Candlestick must be in the Gazebo at 07:00 PM, making Monsieur Brunette's location incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. At 07:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Hatred is in the Dining Room or the Candlestick is in the Gazebo. Therefore, the suspect motivated by Hatred is in the Dining Room, as the Candlestick is in the Gazebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. At 08:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Ambition moved the Lead Pipe from the Gazebo to the Lounge. This implies the Lead Pipe was in the Gazebo at 07:00 PM, so the Gazebo doesn't contain the murder weapon at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. At 09:00 PM, the Revolver was in the Gazebo, but Mr. Boddy was in a different room because the murder occurred at a different time or the murderer was not yet at the scene. Since Mr. Boddy was in the Lounge or the Courtyard at 08:00 PM and the Revolver was not in the Lounge or the Courtyard, Mr. Boddy was in the Lounge at 08:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. At 09:00 PM, the Revolver was in the Gazebo. Since the Gazebo contains the Revolver, the murdere might be the Gazebo at this time. The suspect motivated by Power moved from the Gazebo to the Lounge or the Wrench was moved from the Courtyard to the Library at a different time, so the room containing the Gazebo at 09:00 PM and the Revolver must be the one where the murder took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The Revolver is in the Gazebo at 09:00 PM and the Gazebo is the room where the murder occurred. Mr. Boddy was in the Gazebo at 07:00 PM. Therefore, the murder occurred between 07:00 PM and 09:00 PM. Since Mr. Boddy was in the Gazebo at 09:00 PM, the murder must have occurred at 09:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. At 09:00 PM, Monsieur Brunette was either in the Courttyard or in the Library. If he was in the Library, then Miss Peach moved from the Dining Room to the Library at 10:00 PM or the murderer moved the Wrench from the Courtyard to the Library at 10:00 PM. Since the Wrench was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM and the Courtyard contains the Revolver at 01:00 AM, the Wrench was never in the Library at 10:00 PM. This means Monsieur Brunette was in the Courtyard at 09:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. At 09:00 PM, Mr. Boddy was in the Gazebo, and Mourder is in the Courtyard. At this time the Revolver is on Mr.Boddy so the murderer should be somewhere at the Courtyard fro the Revolver to be in a valid room. Madame Rose motivated by Hatred was in the Dining room at 07:00 PM or the Candlestick was in the Gazebo which it can't be since the murder weapon is the poison.\n",
      "10. Since the murderer them should be in the Courtyard at 09:00 PM, this eliminates the 2 suspects (Miss Peach, Sgt Gray, and the suspect motivated by Fear). In order for the suspect motivated by Ambition, the suspect should have been in the Lounge at 01:00 AM or Miss Peach was in the Lounge at 10:00 PM which both happens to be the case for Miss Peach. The Lounge can't be a correct answer since Miss Peach was in the Dining room at 08:00 PM and the suspect motivated by Ambition moved the Lead pipe at 11:00 PM from the dining room to the Lounge. Thus eliminating the case for Miss Peach.\n",
      "11. The suspect motivated by Power was in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM, meaning they were in the Library at 12:00 AM. Given the suspect motivated by Power moved the Lead Pipe from the Gazebo to the Lounge at 08:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Power moved the Wrench from the Courtyard to the Library at 10:00 PM, and the Wrench was in the room just west of Madame Rose at 01:00 AM, it is clear the Wrench was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM. Therefore the suspect motivated by Power wasn't in the Library at 12:00 AM. This indicates that the suspect motivated by Power was not able to make it to the Library. However, during 11:00 PM, the suspect motivated by Power was in the Library when Miss Peach moved from the Dining Room to the Library. \n",
      "12. At 11:00 PM, the murderer was either in the Courtyard or the suspect moved the Wrench from the Courtyard to the Library. At 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Fear (since the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Library at 09:00 PM and didn't move at 11:00 PM) moved the Wrench from the Dining Room to the Library, but the Wrench was in the room west of Madame rose at 01:00 AM which makes it the case that the Wrench was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM, hence the Wrench was moved at 11:00 PM. This means the murderer was in the Courtyard at 11:00 PM. The suspect motivated by Power was in the Library, and the suspect motivated by Hatred was either in the Dining Room or the Lead Pipe was in the Gazebo. Since the murderer in the Courtyard, this points to the suspect motivated by Hatred located in the Dining Room at 07:00 PM and the murderer = Madame Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Since at 11:00 PM the suspect moved the Wrench, there is only one possible location for the murderer - the murderer could only be the one in the Court and move the Wrench so for the suspect motivated by Power to be in the Library the murderer should be the one in the Gazebo.\n",
      "14.  The suspect motivated by Power moved from the Gazebo to the Lounge at 07:00 PM and the suspect motivated by Power was in the Lounge at 11:00 PM and the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Dining room. Hence, the murderer must be the one who was in the Courtyard, the one who is also in the Gazebo at 09:00 PM and was initially in the Dining Room at 07:00 PM. \n",
      "15. However, at 07:00 PM the suspect motivated by Hatred could have been either the one in the Gazebo at 07:00 PM and the Dining Room was the location of the murderer at the time. Let's assume that it was then the case where the murderer was Madame Rose at the location of the Gazebo.\n",

      "- Since the only locations the Ballroom and Trophy Room share a mutual edge are the locations where the Horseshoe could have been, and \"The Rope was in the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM or the Horseshoe was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM\", this means the Horseshoe must be in the room adjacent to the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM and in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM or the location with the Rope at 12:00 AM would have to be the Trophy Room and Mrs. Peacock can't be there.\n",
      "- Mrs. Peacock was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM and Mr. Boddy was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 12:00 AM, so the Ballroom is where the murder took place.\n",
      "- \"The suspect motivated by Power, Mr. Green can't be in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM because Madame Rose was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM if and only if Mr. Green was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM. Since Mr. Green was in the room with the Horseshoe in the location the Horseshoe was in at 11:45 PM at 11:45 PM, he can't move to the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM and the Horseshoe at 11:45 PM must be in the Room that shares a side with the Trophy Room, which would make the Horseshoe and Rope collide if the Rope was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM, so the Horseshoe must be in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM and the Rope must be in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Since the murder occurred at 12:00 AM with the kill was in the Ballroom, the time was 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Madame Rose was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM and \"The Rope was in the room just north of Madame Rose at 11:45 PM\" the suspect motivated by Anger must be in the room just south of them at 11:45 PM, so Mrs. Peacock's motivation is power, Mr. Green's motivation is Anger, and  Madame Rose's is Hatred.\n",
      "- Since Madame Rose was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM, Madame Rose was not in the room with the Horseshoe in that room at 11:45 PM. Thus Mr. Green was in the room with the Horseshoe at 11:45 PM, which was not the trophy room at 11:45 PM so the Horseshoe must have moved from the room that shares a side with the Trophy Room to the Trophy Room, which implies Mr. Green must have been in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- With Mr. Green in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM \"The suspect motivated by Hatred moved from the Kitchen to the Ballroom at 12:00 AM,\" could not have moved from the Kitchen to the Ballroom at 12:00 AM, since that would make Mrs. Peacock also be in the Ballroom at 11:45 PM. This would make Mr. Green the one who moved from the Kitchen to the Ballroom, but we previously established he moved to the Ballroom at 11:45 PM, which means he would not have known this motive at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- Therefore, the suspect in the Kitchen at 11:45 PM motivated by Anger didn't have to be in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM and could have to have moved to the Ballroom at 11:45 PM and moved the Rope from the Ballroom to the Kitchen at or before 12:00 AM, since Mr. Green is already in the room that shares a side with the Trophy Room, but madame rose would have moved the rope out of the trophy room and into the room immediately north of her by 11:45 PM, but she did not move it to the kitchen. Since the murderer has to be in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM there is only one option: this means the murderers can only be in the room adjacent to the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM (Mr.Green wasn't in this room at 11:45 PM). This means the Horseshoe must be in the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM and the room that shares a side with the Trophy room must be the Trophy Room at 11:45 PM which Mrs. Peacock moved to or the Horseshoe must move from the room that shares a side with the Trophy Room.\n",

      "To solve this, we will use the given clues to deduce the time and location of each suspect. We can then use those times to figure out the exact time and location of the murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"The Revolver was in the Hall at 11:45 PM,\" we can infer that the Professor was in the Hall at 11:45 PM. Given that Mr. Green is motivated by Anger, he cannot be in the same room with the Professor at 11:45 PM. This means Mr. Green is in the north room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Miss Scarlet was in the same room as Professor Plum at 11:45 PM and since Mr. Green is in the north room at 11:45 PM, Miss Scarlet must be in the Hall at 11:45 PM. The Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 11:45 PM or the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM, which means the Wrench is not in the Hall at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. White is motivated by Fear and was in the Conservatory at 11:45 PM if and only if Mr. Boddy was in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM. Since Mr. Boddy was in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM if and only if the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM, we have a contradiction that means Mrs. White cannot be in the Conservatory at 11:45 PM. Mrs. White must be in the Fountain at 12:00 AM. The Wrench cannot be in the Fountain at 12:00 AM because it would imply that the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM and the Horseshoe cannot be in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM given the Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM. This means Mrs. White was in the Fountain at 12:00 AM if and only if the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM.\n",

      "We now have the following times for each room:\n",
      "- East (1) 11:45 PM: Poison\n",

      "From the clue \"The Revolver was in the same room as the Lead Pipe at 11:45 PM,\" we can deduce that the Lead Pipe was in the Hall at 11:45 PM. Therefore, Sgt. Gray was in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Billiard Room was the only possible room for the killer since the Rope was in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM. Mrs. White was in the Fountain at 12:00 AM, and she is motivated by Fear. Therefore, the murder was committed in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM. The Wrench was not in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM since the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM, which implies the Wrench is in the room to the west of Sgt. Gray at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"The Wrench was in the room just west of Sgt. Gray at 12:00 AM,\" we can determine that the Wrench was in the room just west of Sgt. Gray at 11:45 PM. The Wrench and Sgt. Gray cannot be in the same room at 11:45 PM, so the Wrench must be in the north room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Power was Sgt. Gray because the suspect must be in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM, and Sgt. Gray is in the south room at 11:45 PM. The Wrench, being the only possible item in the north room at 11:45 PM, logically represents Power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Billiard Room was the only possible room for the killer, the Wrench cannot be in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM. The Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM if the Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM, so, therefore, the Horseshoe must be in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue \"Mr. Boddy was killed with the Poison\" cannot be the Wrench and therefore, the killer cannot be Mrs. White because the Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM indicating the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM. The murderer must be Sgt. Gray because the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM, which is the only possible item to be in the north room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The murder weapon was in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM. Since the Poison was in the same room as Madame Rose at 11:45 PM and the Poison was the murder weapon, Madame Rose, Mrs. White, and the Horseshoe cannot all be in different rooms at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue \"Mrs. White was in the Conservatory at 11:45 PM if and only if Mr. Boddy was in the Billiard Room at 11:45 PM,\" the Horseshoe must be in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM or the Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 11:45 PM because Mrs. White was in the Conservatory at 11:45 PM would mean the Horseshoe cannot be in the Gazebo at 11:45 PM.\n",

      "8. A suspect motivated by Fear moved from the Conservatory to the Conservatory at some point (Implicit by clue that Professor Plum was in the Conservatory and the Rope was in the Conservatory).\n",
      "9. The suspect motivated by Jealousy and the Rope were in the Lounge together at least once (Clue).\n",

If the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM, Mr. Boddy must have been in the Billiard Room at 12:15 AM (Clue 8), which is a contradiction since Mr. Boddy was already in the Billiard Room at 12:15 AM. Therefore, the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Study at 12:00 AM. Since Mr. Green was in the Hall at 11:45 PM if and only if the Poison was in the Hall at 12:15 AM (Clue 18), the Poison cannot be in the Hall at 12:15 AM, which means the suspect motivated by Greed was not in the Hall at 11:45 PM. Hence, at 11:45 PM, the suspect motivated by Greed must be in the Study and Mr. Green was either in the Kitchen or the Hall, while Mrs. White was in the Billiard Room. If the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Study at 12:00 AM, Mr. Green being in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM is more likely, considering that the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Kitchen at this time (Clue 22).\n",

      "1. Mrs. White was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM if and only if the Rope was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM. Mrs. White(D) so Rope(A).\n",
      "2. Mrs. White moved from the Ballroom to the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM. Mrs. White(B) - (10 -> 14).\n",
      "3. Professor Plum was in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM or Madame Rose was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM. \"or\" is not necessary.\n",
      "4. Madame Rose was in the room just east of the Horseshoe at 12:00 AM -> Madame Rose(78, 10), so Horseshoe(E).\n",
      "5. Room 07 is the room just E of Horseshoe, so Madame Rose was in Room 07 at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "6. Miss Peach was in the Hall at 11:30 PM if and only if Colonel Mustard was in the Library at 11:30 PM -> Miss Peach(16) so Colonel Mustard(88).\n",
      "7. Mr. Boddy was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM or the Revolver was in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM -> Mr. Boddy(1), however Revolver(A) -> Revolver is unassigned.\n",
      "8. Miss Peach was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM if and only if Colonel Mustard was in the Library at 12:00 AM -> Miss Peach(17) so Colonel Mustard(89).\n",
      "9. Miss Scarlet was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "10. Mr. Boddy was in the Hall at 12:00 AM or the murderer was at the Fountain at 12:00 AM. No possible killers could take place at the Fountain at 12:00 AM with the facts we know so far.\n",
      "11. Colonel Mustard was in the Library at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "12. Mrs. Peacock moved from the Billiard Room to the Hall at 12:00 AM.  Mrs. Peacock(31) -> Hall(N), however she could not have moved alone, this must have been some kind of collaborative effort.\n",
      "13. The Horseshoe was in the same room as the Candlestick at 12:00 AM -> Horseshoe(10) so Candlestick(10).\n",
      "14. Professor Plum was in the Kitchen at 11:30 PM or the murderer was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM. \"or\" is not necessary.\n",
      "15. Miss Scarlet was in the same room as the Rope at 11:30 PM -> Rope(10), however the exact suspect is still unknown.\n",
      "16. Mr. Boddy was at the Fountain at 12:00 AM if and only if Monsieur Brunette was at the Fountain at 12:00 AM -> Mr. Boddy(4) so Monsieur Brunette(46).\n",
      "17. The Lead Pipe was in the Drawing Room at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "18. The Knife and Professor Plum were in the Kitchen together at least once -> Knife(1) -> (Knife in the Kitchen corresponds with Mr. Boddy and Professor Plum in the Kitchen. Mr. Boddy not being in the kitchen cannot happen if anyone else is in the kitchen at this time as the location at the end of the game will show that Mr. Boddy and Professor Plum are in the kitchen).\n",
      "19. The Horseshoe and the Wrench were in the Studio together at least once -> Wrench(5), however the exact room is not determined.\n",
      "20. Mrs. White was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM if and only if the Rope was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM -> Mrs. White(100) so Rope(6).\n",
      "21. Mrs. White is in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, so she must have been in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM, hence Rope(6).\n",
      "22. Mrs. White is actually in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM, so this means the Rope was in the Ballroom at both times.\n",
      "23. Mr. Green was in the same room as Monsieur Brunette at 11:30 PM -> Mr. Green(34) so Monsieur Brunette(45).\n",
      "24. Mr. Boddy and Madame Rose were at the Fountain together at least once -> Mr. Boddy(4) so Madame Rose(45).\n",
      "25. Mr. Green was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "26. Sgt. Gray was in the room just north of Mr. Green at 11:30 PM -> Sgt. Gray(59) so Mr. Green(34) was incorrect.\n",
      "27. Sgt. Gray was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM -> Sgt. Gray(58).\n",
      "28. 58 must be north of Mr. Green at 11:30 PM and 12:00 AM. Thus, 59 is the location of Sgt. Gray(61) instead and Mr. Green(62) at both times.\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "The information states that the murderer was in the Cloak Room and Mr. Green is motivated by Fear. Since Mr. Green is the murderer, the motive is Fear. The rope is in the room just north of Mr. Green, which would be room 2. The room just north of room 2 is room 1, but certain rooms are eliminated due to other clues. The revolver is in the room just east of the Wrench, but the Wrench is in room 3 and the revolver is in room 6, eliminating those rooms as the murder location.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only room that is not yet eliminated is the Cloak Room because the murderer is in it. To go against this, consider the Wrench's location being in room 3, which is west of Mrs. Peacock. The Room just west of Mrs. Peacock is the first row (the first row consists of rooms 1, 2, and 3), so the room just west of Mrs. Peacock can not be occupied by her, thus the Wrench is in room 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the murderer is in the Cloak Room, the location of the Wrench and its position, and the location of the revolver, we can determine that the revolver is in the studio (room 6), the Wrench in the Billiard Room (room 3), and the Rope in room 2.\n",

      "G. Library\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "From the clues, we infer that Mrs. Peacock, the Horseshoe, the Rope, and the Revolver moved between rooms over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the Horseshoe being in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM, it means that either the Horseshoe was moved from the Kitchen or Mrs. Peacock is motivated by Power, since the Horseshoe was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Horseshoe was in the room just south of the Poison at 12:00 AM and the Poison was in the Billiard Room at some point, it means that the Horseshoe was moved from the Kitchen to the room where the Poison was found (Billiard Room).\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mrs. Peacock was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 11:30 PM, the Horseshoe moving from the Kitchen to the room where the Poison was found means Mrs. Peacock was also in the Billiard Room at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue that Mrs. Peacock and the Horseshoe moved from the Kitchen to the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM implies that Mrs. White, who moved from the Kitchen to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM, is motivated by Greed, as read from another clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Billiard Room to the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM, and the Horseshoe was in the room where the suspect motivated by Power was, the Horseshoe must be in the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM. So, Mrs. Peacock was in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM, and the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Billiard Room to the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM. By process of elimination, this suspect motivated by Power is either Colonel Mustard or Professor Plum.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mrs. White was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM, and she is motivated by Greed, she is eliminated from being in the Billiard Room, and thus the suspect motivated by Power is not Mrs. White.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Fountain, Mr. Boddy must have been in the Studio at 12:00 AM for the suspect motivated by Betrayal to be in the Fountain, and Madame Rose, who was in the Dining Room, cannot be motivated by Betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the clue that the suspect motivated by Betrayal was at the Fountain at 12:00 AM, if and only if Mr. Boddy was in the Studio at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Betrayal is either Madame Rose or Miss Scarlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Colonel Mustard and Madame Rose were in the Dining Room together at least once, the suspect motivated by Betrayal cannot be Madame Rose since she cannot be in the Studio and the Dining Room at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Revolver was in the same room as Madame Rose at 11:30 PM and was not with them, the Revolver must have moved from the Room containing Professor Plum (if the Revolver was with Professor Plum) or the room with Colonel Mustard. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, if Madame Rose was in the Studio at 12:00 AM, then she could only have moved from either the Dining Room or the Kitchen, so the Revolver must have been in either of those 2 rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue that Colonel Mustard and Madame Rose were in the Dining Room together at least once, this implies that Madame Rose was in the Dining Room at 11:30 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Madame Rose moved from the Kitchen to the Bathroom is not a valid move (there are no such a room), then the Revolver was in the room just south of Colonel Mustard. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue that the suspect motivated by Anger moved from the room with the Revolver to the room with the Rope, since Madame Rose was in the room with the Revolver at 11:30 PM and in a different room at 12:00 AM, and the suspect motivated by Anger must have moved to the room where the Rope is, the suspect motivated by Anger must be Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it is known that either the Revolver or the Rope was in the room with Colonel Mustard or Madame Rose, the suspect motivated by Anger was in the room with Colonel Mustard at 12:00 AM, and could not have been in that room at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Anger is Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at Colonel Mustard's possible motives from the prompt (Fear, Greed, Power, Jealousy, Anger, Betrayal), and considering the information gathered from the clues, while the suspect motivated by Power is in the Library at 12:00 AM (Monsieur Brunette moved from the Studio to the Library), Colonel Mustard's motive cannot be Power (as Mrs. Peacock, the Horseshoe, and the suspect motivated by Power are in the Billiard Room or in the Trophy Room at some time), nor Jealousy (as he was in the same room with a different person than the suspect motivated by Jealousy at 12:00 AM). \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the remaining options, Mrs. White is motivated by Greed and, according to a prior conclusion, Mrs. Peacock and the suspect motivated by Fear are not in the Dining Room, then Mrs. Peacock and the suspect motivated by Fear cannot be in the same room together, the suspect motivated by Fear and Mrs. Peacock cannot be in the same room at any point over the time period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the suspect motivated by Fear can be in the room with no one at the time of the murder, the suspect motivated by Fear must be in the room with the Rope at 11:30 PM. As Miss Peach and the Poison are in the Billiard Room together at least once, if the Rope is not in the Billiard Room, then Mr. Boddy must be in the room with the Rope at some point, which in turn means the suspect motivated by Power, Mr. Boddy, and the Horseshoe must be in the same room. By process of elimination, this means the Rope was in the Billiard Room at 11:30 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the suspect motivated by Anger, the Revolver, the Horseshoe, and Mrs. Peacock are in the Billiard Room. As the murder could only have occurred in one room, and the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Billiard Room to the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM, the murder cannot have occurred in the Billiard Room. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mrs. White cannot be in the Billiard Room at the same time as the Horseshoe and the Rope, the suspect motivated by Power cannot be Mrs. White, and since the Horseshoe was in the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Power is Professor Plum.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue that the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Billiard Room to the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM, and the suspect motivated by Power is Professor Plum, then either he moved from the Billiard Room (which has the Rope) or the Kitchen. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, Professor Plum was in the same room as the Revolver at 11:30 PM, so the Revolver was in the room with Professor Plum at 11:30 PM either in the Kitchen or in the room to the north of Colonel Mustard and 2 rooms east of the Carriage House (Dining Room).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Professor Plum moved the Revolver from the Carriage House (which he never visited) to the Kitchen, the Revolver must be in the Kitchen at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) was in the Kitchen at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Power, Professor Plum, must have been in the room to the west of the Kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the clue that a suspect motivated by Power was in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Power must be in the room east of the Kitchen at 12:00 AM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Professor Plum moved from the Kitchen to the room to the west of the Kitchen at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Power is Professor Plum.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the suspect motivated by Betrayal is at the Fountain at 12:00 AM if and only if Mr. Boddy was in the Studio at 12:00 AM, and Mr. Boddy can only be in one room, then the suspect motivated by Betrayal must be Madame Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the suspect motivated by Power and Power moving from the Billiard Room to the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM, and the suspect motivated by Power in the room to the east of the Kitchen at 12:00 AM, Professor Plum must have moved from the Kitchen to the Tower so the room east of the Tower (Library) is to the west of the Kitchen, Professor Plum is in the Library at 11:30 PM at some point.\n",

If the Revolver was in the Studio, the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Kitchen at 01:30 AM. But if the suspect motivated by Anger was in the Kitchen at 01:30 AM, the Revolver could not be in the Studio at 10:00 PM. So, the Revolver must be in the Studio at 10:00 PM.\n",
      "3. The Lead Pipe was moved from the Billiard Room to the Kitchen at 11:00 PM (given).\n",
      "4. A suspect motivated by Anger was in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM or the Rope was in the Kitchen at 10:00 PM (given). The Rope was in the Study at 10:00 PM, so a suspect motivated by Anger was in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM.\n",

The murderer (Professor Plum) moved the Lead Pipe from the Billiard Room to the Kitchen at 11:00 PM, so one possible sequence is that the murderer moved the Lead Pipe to the Kitchen, then to the room with the Knife (Kitchen) at 10:30 PM, then the Lead Pipe moved to the room with the Lead Pipe, and finally the Lead Pipe was moved to the room with the Poison at 01:30 AM.\n",

Since a suspect motivated by Anger moved from the Conservatory to the Library at 10:30 PM (step 22), the suspect motivated by Anger moved from the Conservatory to the Library at 10:30 PM because Mr. Boddy was already in the Kitchen at 10:00 PM and stayed there until 11:00 PM, so a suspect motivated by Anger must stay in the Conservatory until 10:30 PM.\n",

      "E. Jealousy\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "- The Revolver was in the Study at 12:00 AM, and the Revolver and Mr. Green were in the Study together at least once, so the Revolver must be in the Study at 11:00 PM. Therefore, Mr. Green was in the room just west of the Rope at 11:00 PM. This means Mr. Green was in the room just west of the Rope at 11:00 PM and the Rope was in the room just west of Mrs. Peach at 11:00 PM, so Mrs. Peach was in the Rope's room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- Since Mrs. Peach and Mr. Boddy were in the same room at least once, this implies that Mrs. Peach was in the room with the Rope at 11:00 PM, which is the same room as Mr. Green at 11:00 PM. The Rope was in the room just east of Mrs. White at 11:00 PM, so the room we have been searching for contains Mrs. White at 11:00 PM and this room must be the room that the Rope was in at 11:00 PM. This is the room that must contain the Rope at 12:00 AM as well.\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Ambition was in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM. The Wrench was either in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM or the Poison was in the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM. This means that the Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM, so a suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Wrench's room (Cloak Room) at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Mrs. Peacock moved 4 rooms. Thus she could not have been in the Cloak Room until 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Pride moved from the Kitchen to the Courtyard at 12:00 AM, so the Killer could not be motivated by Pride. \n",
      "- Mrs. Peacock is a suspect motivated by Ambition. Mrs. Peacock must have moved north from the Kitchen to the Lounge, then east from the Lounge to the Courtyard. The Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM, and since Mrs. Peacock moved north from the Kitchen to the Lounge and then east from the Lounge to the Courtyard at 12:00 AM, the Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Ambition was in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM. Thus Mrs. Peacock was in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM. If Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Wrench at 12:00 AM, this means that Mrs. Peacock was in the Wrench's room (Cloak Room) at 11:00 PM. (For she cannot have been in the room with the Wrench at 11:00 PM because that would force her to be in a room with the Wrench at 12:00 AM and move 1 room south to the Lounge, east to the Courtyard, at the same time, which would be impossible since the murderer must have been alone in the room with the murder weapon at 12:00 AM, but the Wrench must have been in the room with the Killer at 12:00 AM, so the Killer must have moved to the room with the Wrench at 12:00 AM.)\n",
      "- The Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Courtyard, her room that contains the Wrench at 11:00 PM is the room just south of the room that Mrs. Peacock is in at 11:00 PM. However, a suspect motivated by Fear moved from the Cloak Room to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM, implying that the Wrench or the Poison must be in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Wrench at 11:00 PM and she was not in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM (for Mrs. Peacock must have moved to the Lounge at 11:00 PM), Mrs. Peacock can't be in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Fear moved from the Cloak Room to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM. We have determined that the Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM. Thus the suspect motivated by Fear was in the room with the Wrench at 11:00 PM, which is the same room that we've been trying to determine was the room that the Rope was in at 11:00 PM. Since the Room is Mrs. White's, the suspect motivated by Fear was in the room that Mrs. White was in at 11:00 PM (Room we have been searching for). This means that Mrs. White must have moved from the room that Mrs. White was in at 11:00 PM to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- According to the above deduction, Mrs. Peacock was in the Lounge at 11:00 PM, so Mrs. Peacock must have moved from the Lounge to the Courtyard at 12:00 AM and then moved one room south at 12:00 AM. This implies that Mrs. Peacock was in the room south of the room Mrs. Peacock is in at 12:00 AM at 11:00 PM. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Wrench at 11:00 PM, we can conclude the Wrench must be in Mrs. Peacock's room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Wrench at 12:00 AM and must have moved 1 room south to the room with the Rope at 12:00 AM. Since Mrs. White was in the room just east of the Rope at 11:00 PM, Mrs. Peacock must have moved into the room that Mrs. White was in at 11:00 PM at 12:00 AM. This means that Mrs. Peacock was in Mrs. White's room at 11:00 PM. Thus Mrs. Peacock and Mrs. White must have been in the same room at 11:00 PM, and the room Mrs. Peacock and Mrs. White were in at 11:00 PM is Mrs. Peacock's room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "- Mrs. Peacock could not have been in the room with the Rope at 11:00 PM, for the Rope was in Mrs. White's room at 11:00 PM, and Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Wrench at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- The Wrench was in the Cloak Room at 11:00 PM. As Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Wrench at 11:00 PM, Mrs. Peacock was in the room that Mrs. White was in at 11:00 PM, and Mrs. Peacock must have moved to the room with the Wrench at 12:00 AM, we can now conclude that the Wrench was in the room that Mrs. Peacock was in at 12:00 AM at 11:00 PM. Mrs. Peacock was in Mrs. White's room at 12:00 AM, and Mrs. Peacock must have been in the room with the Rope at 11:00 PM. Thus the Rope must have been in the room that Mrs. Peacock was in at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Ambition was in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM. The Wrench was in Mrs. Peacock's room at 11:00 PM, and the room Mrs. Peacock was in at 11:00 PM is Mrs. Peacock's room at 12:00 AM. Mrs. Peacock was in Mrs. White's room at 12:00 AM. We can conclude that a suspect motivated by Ambition was in Mrs. Peacock's room at 12:00 AM, which is Mrs. White's room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Wrench at 11:00 PM, and Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Rope at 12:00 AM. The Rope was in the room that Mrs. White was in at 11:00 PM. Mrs. Peacock was in the same room with the Rope at 11:00 PM. Since Mrs. Peacock was in Mrs. White's room at 12:00 AM, Mrs. Peacock's room at 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM must be Mrs. White's room.\n",
      "- Thus Mrs. Peacock was in the same room with the Rope at 11:00 PM and was in Mrs. White's room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Ambition was in the same room as the Wrench at 12:00 AM. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the room with the Wrench at 11:00 PM, Mrs. White was in Mrs. Peacock's room at 11:00 PM, and Mrs. Peacock and Mrs. White were in the same room at 11:00 PM. Mrs. Peacock's room at 12:00 AM is Mrs. White's room at 11:00 PM. The Wrench was in Mrs. White's room\n",

      "The solution can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start with clue 15: At 12:00 AM, the Horseshoe was in the room just south of Miss Scarlet. This suggests that the Horseshoe was in the Lounge, as the Lounge is just south of Miss Scarlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Find Miss Scarlet's location at 12:00 AM: From clue 15, Miss Scarlet is south of (and possibly in) the Lounge at 12:00 AM. The Horseshoe cannot be in the same room as Miss Scarlet at 12:00 AM, it must be in the Lounge. Follow this back to the Horseshoe must be beside Miss Scarlet at 12:00 AM. Since the Horseshoe, Miss Scarlet, and the Lounge are in a straight line, Miss Scarlet must be in the Lounge at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use clue 3: The Knife was in the same room as the Revolver at 11:45 PM. Since the Revolver cannot be in the Hall at 11:45 PM (the Hall has the Horseshoe), both the Knife and the Revolver must be in the Hall at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Deduce the possible locations of the remaining rooms and suspects at the 11:45 PM and 12:00 AM timepoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "   N N N  \n",
      "W 1|2|3 E \n",
      "W 4|5|6 E\n",
      "W 7|8|- E\n",
      "  S S S  \n",
      "\n",
      "At 11:45 PM:\n",
      "From 1 - 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  \n",
      "From 7 and 8: 7, 8\n",
      "\n",
      "The possible places for the suspects are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Monsieur Brunette (east) or Sgt. Gray (east) has to be in the Hall to fulfill the Knife and Revolver clue (4) at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "- Madame Rose (north), Miss Peach (north), or Miss Scarlet (north) must be in room 1.\n",
      "- Room 6 is empty at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsieur Brunette is in the Hall at 11:45 PM because if he was not already there, Sgt. Gray must have taken the Horseshoe to 5, and Madame Rose, Miss Peach, or Miss Scarlet could have taken the Horseshoe to the Hall. At 11:45 PM, the Horseshoe being in the Hall is not possible. Also, Monsieur Brunette and Sgt. Gray would not be able to meet at 12:00 AM in the Lounge because Sgt. Gray has no free movement at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now deduce the locations at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Library at 12:00 AM. From clue 14, the suspect motivated by Power moved from the Cloak Room to the Lounge at 12:00 AM, so the Power motive must be connected with a suspect in the Cloak Room that would be in the Lounge at 12:00 AM. Since Sgt. Gray must be in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM, the Power motive can be connected with Sgt. Gray.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Ambition moved from the Library to the Cloak Room, so the Ambition motive must be connected with the suspect in the Library at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Fear was in the room with Sgt. Gray at 11:45 PM. The Hall is the only room that could have a suspect with no possible other suitable movement at 11:45 PM, so the Fear motive is connected to Monsieur Brunette.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sgt. Gray, having moved to the Lounge, cannot fulfill the Power motive, so it cannot be Sgt. Gray. The only remaining motive is Pride, leaving Miss Peach as the suspect with Passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Rose cannot be in the Hall because she would have to be in the Hall first and then move out. However, this would mean the Horseshoe would have to be in one of the rooms beside the Lounge at 11:45 PM, which contradicts clue 5.\n",

      "A. Mrs. White was in the room just north of the Wrench at 01:00 AM, but it was Sgt. Gray who was in that room. Sgt. Gray was in the room just north of Miss Scarlet, and Miss Scarlet was at the Fountain at 12:45 AM. So Sgt. Gray was at the Fountain at 12:45 AM. Since Sgt. Gray was in the Billiard Room at 12:45 AM, the correct room would be the room above the Billiard Room. But since there is a room above the Billiard Room in the layout which is the Drawing Room, another suspect must be Sgt. Gray at the Billiard Room. The person in the Drawing Room at 01:00 AM was Professor Plum, but Professor Plum was in the Drawing Room at 12:45 AM. Then Sgt. Gray was not with Mrs. White at the Kitchen at 12:45 AM. Therefore Sgt. Gray was in the Billiard Room at 12:45 AM, which means Sgt. Gray could not have been with Mrs. Peacock at 11:30 PM. So Sgt. Gray was indeed not with Mrs. Peacock at 11:30 PM, but Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM. Therefore, Mrs. Peacock was not with Sgt. Gray at 11:30 PM. Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the room just east of Professor Plum, who was in the room just east of Mrs. Peacock at 12:00 AM, so Professor Plum was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM. Monsieur Brunette was in the Kitchen at 12:00 AM or the murderer was at the Fountain at 12:45 AM. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM, Mrs. Peacock was indeed not the murderer. If Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the room just east of Professor Plum at 12:00 AM, Mrs. Peacock could not have been the murderer, but Sgt. Gray was indeed in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 11:30 PM. Since Mrs. Peacock and Sgt. Gray were in the same room at 11:30 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM, Mrs. Peacock and Sgt. Gray could not both be the murderers. \n",

      "Mrs. White was in the same room as the Poison at 12:30 AM and the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Kitchen at 12:45 AM, then Mrs. White was not in the Kitchen at 12:45 AM, thus the assumption that Mrs. White was in the same room as the Poison at 12:30 AM was incorrect. Mrs. White was in the Dining Room at 12:45 AM if and only if the Horseshoe was in the Carriage House at 12:15 AM. But since Mrs. White was in the Dining Room at 12:45 AM, Mrs. White could not have been with the Horseshoe at 12:15 AM. The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 12:15 AM. But since Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM, it is now clear that the suspect motivated by Hatred could not be in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM but could be there at 12:30 AM. Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 12:15 AM. Therefore, Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) was in the room just east of Mrs. Peacock at 12:15 AM. Mrs. Peacock was in the Carriage House at 12:15 AM and the Lead Pipe was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 11:30 PM, thus Mrs. Peacock could not be in the same room with the Lead Pipe at 11:30 PM. If Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) was in the room just east of Mrs. Peacock at 12:15 AM, the Lead Pipe could not have been in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 11:30 PM, so the suspect motivated by Power could not be in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 11:30 PM. Since Mrs. White was in the Dining Room at 12:45 AM, it follows that the Horseshoe could not have been in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM and the Horseshoe was in the room just west of the Lead Pipe at 12:45 AM. Since the Horseshoe was in the room just west of the Lead Pipe at 12:45 AM, the Lead Pipe was in the same room with the suspect motivated by Hatred at 12:45 AM. The Lead Pipe was in the same room as the suspect motivated by Revenge at 11:30 PM. At 12:45 AM, Mrs. Peacock could not be in the same room with the Horseshoe, so if the Horseshoe was in the Carriage House at 12:15 AM, the Lead Pipe could not have been in the same room with the Horseshoe at 12:45 AM. Since the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the room just east of the Lead Pipe at 12:45 AM, the Lead Pipe could not have been in the same room with Mrs. Peacock at 11:30 AM but the Lead Pipe was in the same room with Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) at 11:30 PM.

The suspect motivated by Fear was in the same room as the Lead Pipe at 11:45 PM. The Lead Pipe was in the same room as the suspect motivated by Revenge at 11:30 PM. But the Lead Pipe moved from the Studio to the Trophy Room at 12:15 AM, thus Mrs. Peacock, who was not in the same room as the Horseshoe at 11:30 PM, could be in the same room as the Lead Pipe at 11:30 PM. If the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the room just east of the Lead Pipe at 12:45 AM, Mrs. Peacock was indeed in the same room with the Lead Pipe at 12:45 AM.

The phenomenon that \"any clue about Mr. Boddy's whereabouts should be read as Mr. Boddy (dead or alive)...\" is thus that Mr. Boddy was in the Hall at 01:00 AM.

      "The murderer is Colonel Mustard as he is the only one motivated by Pride, and it is the only motive with a unique solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Mustard moved from the room just east of the Revolver, which was Mrs. Peacock, to the room just south of the Revolver which we will call room 2 at 11:45 PM, as Colonel Mustard was in the same room as Mrs. White at 11:45 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mrs. White was in the room just south of the Revolver at 11:45 PM, room 2 is the room just south of the Revolver, which means the room just north of the Revolver is room 1. Since the murder weapon was in the Study at 11:45 PM if and only if the Poison was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM, it cannot be the Study that has the murder weapon, so the Carriage House must have the Poison at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "A suspect motivated by Revenge and the Poison were in the Carriage House together at least once. \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the Poison was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM, if Colonel Mustard is the Murderer, he must also be in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM. If he is in the Carriage House, the Revolver must be in the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM or he would be in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 12:00 AM, but that would mean he was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the room just east of the Revolver, which means the Revolver is room 6 and is impossible because room 6 is east of the rooms 1-4. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Colonel Mustard is in the room just south of the Revolver and the Revolver is not in room 4, room 4 is not the room just south of the Revolver. If the Revolver was in the room just north of the Revolver, Colonel Mustard cannot be in the room just south of the Revolver at 11:45 PM because the room just north of the Revolver is room 1 and the room just south of the Revolver would be room 9 with only two possible options: room 2 or room 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "If room 2 is the room just south of the Revolver, the room must be just north of the Revolver be room 3. However, if the Revolver is in room 3, the room just south of the Revolver would be room 9, and the Revolver cannot be in room 2 since room 2 is the room just south of the Revolver at 11:45 PM. We can now eliminate room 3 as the room just south of the Revolver.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only remaining option is room 8. If the Revolver is in room 3, the room just north of the Revolver will be room 7, but the Revolver cannot be room 7 since it's room 3, so the room just north of the room 3 must be room 1, which leaves only room 8 for the room just south of the Revolver.\n",

      "Since room 8 is the room just south of the Revolver and room 3 is the room just north of the Revolver, the Revolver in room 3 is confirmed. Considering the Revolver is in room 3, the Revolver and Mr. Green were in the Study together at least once. Therefore, the room that can have the Revolver and Mr. Green is room 6 which can be eliminated from being the room of the murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Revolver is in room 3, room 8 is the room just south of the Revolver at 11:45 PM, which means room 7 is the room just north of the Revolver, and since Mrs. Peacock was in the room just east of the Revolver at 12:15 AM and room 7 is the room just north of the Revolver at 11:45 PM, the Revolver must be in room 6 and room 6 is the room just east of the Revolver.\n",

      "Colonel Mustard was in room 8 at 11:45 and Mr. Boddy must be in the same room with Colonel Mustard. Mrs. Peacock was in room 9 at 11:45 and it's impossible to explain her first for this question but she is going to be in the room with Colonel Mustard. Mr. Green was in room 7 at 11:45 which will lead to the study. Miss Peach was with Sgt. Gray at 11:45 PM.\n",

Therefore, the Carriage House at 11:45 PM must be empty. Given the Horseshoe is in room 9, and room 8 cannot be the Horseshoe as the Horseshoe cannot be in room 8 at 11:45, the Carriage House at 12:00 AM cannot have the Horseshoe.\n",

      "Colonel Mustard was in the room with the Poison at 12:00 AM if it's room 4, but it cannot be room 4 so the poison must have been in the room with the Horseshoe at 11:45 PM, which is room 9. Considering the Horseshoe in room 9 at 11:45, room 9 is confirmed as the room that must contain the Horseshoe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Horseshoe is in the room 9 at 11:45 PM and Mr. Boddy was in the Drawing Room at 11:45 PM or it does not use the Horseshoe as a murder weapon, Mr. Boddy must be in the Drawing Room at 11:45 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the Poison is in room 9 at 11:45 PM with the Horseshoe, Sgt. Gray was in room 8 at 11:45 and must be in room 8 and the Revolver is in room 3 which will later lead to the study. Therefore, \n",
      "\n",
      "Room 7 at 11:45 PM was confirmed as the room that Mr. Green was in. But since he was with the Horseshoe at 11:45 PM, it must be room 7 as the room that contains the Horseshoe which is impossible as the Horseshoe is in room 9. So, this scenario can be disregarded. \n",

      "After re-evaluating all the clues, the resolving statement of the Horseshoe in the room just west of Sgt. Gray at 12:00 AM, and Mr. Green in room 3 and there is only one direction that leaves the Horseshoe in the room 9 at the time of 11:45 PM, Mr. Green must be in room 9 at 11:45 PM which was initially impossible. It must be reassessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous statement of the Horseshoe was in the room 9 at 11:45 PM was incorrect and the Wrench must be in room 9. The Wrench being in the room 9 at 11:45 PM makes Mr. Green in room 7 and Sgt. Gray in room 8 at 11:45. The Revolver must be in room 3 at 11:45 PM as the room just north of room 3 must be room 2, which will be Mrs. White's room, and room 1 must be Mr. Boddy's room. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Roape is in the room just west of the Wrench at 12:15 AM, the Revolver cannot be in room 7 as room 7 is west of room 8 which has no room to be west of room 8 at 11:45 PM.

      "\n",
      "Note: \n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Since the murder occurred at 01:30 AM, Professor Plum must be motivated by Jealousy. At 01:00 AM, Professor Plum (motivated by Jealousy) was in the Studio, so he must have moved there before 11:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) At 01:00 AM, Mr. Boddy was in the Studio with no other suspects present. However, at 01:30 AM, Professor Plum was in the Hall with the Revolver.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Professor Plum must have moved the Revolver to the Hall before 11:00 PM, so it was in the Hall with another suspect at 10:30 PM (also) Mrs. Peacock, who moved the Poison from the Lounge to the Hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) This means Professor Plum saw the Revolver in the hands of Mrs. Peacock. Given this, Professor Plum is motivated by Jealousy.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Since Professor Plum was motivated by Jealousy, the only room where the murderer and the victim could have been alone with an item (Wrench) is the Hall or the Study.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6) At 01:00 AM, the Wrench must have been moved to the Hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "(7) Since Mrs. Peacock was seen moving the Wrench to the Hall at 11:00 PM, Mrs. Peacock must have moved the Murder weapon to the Study (closer to Mr. Boddy).\n",
      "\n",
      "(8) Mr. Boddy was not in the Study at 10:30 PM or 11:00 PM. In the 1-hour span between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM, Mr. Boddy must have left the Cloak Room (for some reason).\n",
      "\n",
      "(9) Since he was in the Cloak Room at 12:00 AM, he must have been there before 11:30 PM as well. So the suspect in the Hall at 10:30 PM or 11:00 PM (Mrs. Peacock) was in the Cloak Room.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10) At 01:30 AM, Mr. Boddy is dead. The candidate suspects who could have committed the crime are either Mrs. Peacock or Professor Plum. \n",
      "\n",
      "(11) The suspect in the Hall at 10:30 PM moved the Poison to the Lounge and must have been Mrs. Peacock. Mrs. Peacock was also at the Hall at 12:00 AM (and thus had the chance to move the knife to the Hall at 11:00 PM).\n",
      "\n",
      "(12) Therefore, Professor Plum must be the suspect.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "Mrs. Peacock was in the Ballroom with the Poison at 12:00 AM, and the Poison was in the Library at 01:00 AM. This implies that the Poison must have been moved by Mrs. Peacock from the Library to the Ballroom and then back from the Ballroom to the Library. Since the murder had to occur at 12:00 AM and the body was found in the Library, this makes the Library the murder room. \n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Mustard, motivated by Jealousy, was in the Lounge at 11:00 PM, but could not have moved the Candlestick, as the candle stuck is in the same room as Miss Scarlet, who was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM. This means Colonel Mustard was not in the same room as the Candlestick at 01:00 AM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since a suspect motivated by Power was in the Drawing Room at 01:00 AM if and only if Professor Plum was in the Dining Room at 11:00 PM, Professor Plum must be the suspect motivated by Power, and was in the Dining Room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "As only one suspect could have been in the same room as the Lead Pipe at 11:00 PM, Professor Plum must have been in the Conservatory at 11:00 PM, as the Lead Pipe was in the Conservatory at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Miss Scarlet was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM, the Candlestick must have been in the Lounge at 11:00 PM. This implies that it was moved to an adjacent room by the suspect motivated by Anger. The suspect motivated by Anger must have been in the Carriage House at 11:00 PM because Mrs. Peacock was not in the Carriage House at this time (she was at 11:00 PM in the Kitchen with a fellow suspect). The Anger suspect then must have moved to the Lounge at 12:00 AM to put the Candlestick there.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Green moved with the Knife, the suspect moved with the Horseshoe, and the Lead Pipe was moved by a suspect motivated by Pride, then it is possible to check all places and times to establish this:\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Greed moved the Horseshoe with the suspect motivated by Greed as the Horseshoe was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Colonel Mustard and Mrs. Peacock were in the Kitchen together, the suspect motivated by Greed could not have moved the Horseshoe if they were in the Courtyard.\n",

      "1. First, let's use the given information that \"Professor Plum is motivated by Greed\" and \"The Lead Pipe was at the Fountain if and only if the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Gazebo.\" Since Professor Plum is motivated by Greed, we can deduce that the Lead Pipe cannot be at the Fountain, and thus, Mrs. Peacock is in the Gazebo. Also, by the 'if and only if' condition, the Lead Pipe is at the Fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"The Lead Pipe was at the Fountain if and only if the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Gazebo,\" implies that the Lead Pipe is at the Fountain, and 'The Lead Pipe was at the Fountain if and only if the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Gazebo,' so the suspect motivated by Greed, which is Professor Plum, must be in the Gazebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Now look at the 'The Wrench was at the Fountain or the Poison was in the Study.' We now know that the Lead Pipe (one of the options in the Wrench|Poison|Leaded Pipe|Knife sequence) is at the Fountain. Since the wrench and the poison are the remaining option pair, the poison must be in the Study and the wrench is at the Fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Now, \"The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Kitchen\" can be applied to the suspects left. As Mrs. Peacock was found to be in the Gazebo and Professor Plum in the Gazebo, the suspect motivated by Hatred must be in the Kitchen. Since the bonus states that Mrs. White is in the room just east of Mrs. Peacock and Professor Plum is in the room just north of Mrs. Peacock, it follows that Mr. Plum and Mrs. White are in rooms 1 and 2. Since Mrs. White is in the room just east of Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum (Mrs. Peacock's north neighbour) must be in the West of Mrs. White. Hence room 1 is in the North and room 2 is East of it. Hence since we already know that the suspect motivated by Hatred is in the Kitchen which must be room 2 (since 'North' was taken), it can't be Mrs. White. As Mrs. White was in room 2, the household that doesn't want to be in any room with an even number (meaning they are left with option 3 or 4), Mrs. Peacock must be in the room with the even number, Kitchen. (Kitchen = 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 'The murder weapon was in the Kitchen or Mrs. White was at the Fountain' + The Poison was in the Study and the wrench was at the Fountain can be used to find the room where the murder occurred. As Mrs. White is in the room with an even number but the Poison and Wrench aren't at the Kitchen, Mrs. White must be on the other side of the room which has the third number. So the Gazebo must be the room with a killer with an odd number which leaves the room with the Kitchen which must be the 4 (that has an even number) to be the Kitchen so the murder must have been in the kitchen which is the room with the even number.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Using \"Mrs. White was in the room just east of Mrs. Peacock,\" Mrs. Peacock must be to the south of Mrs. White. As the suspect is in the Kitchen, Mrs. Peacock must be at room 4, not Mrs. White. So Mrs. White is in the room to the north of the kitchen (East of Peacock which is room 4 hence room 3), meaning Mrs. White must be in the Study and the Poison (also at room 3 which is the study) must be the weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Using \"The suspect motivated by Ambition was at the Fountain,\" and given that Mrs. Peacock is not in the Fountain, Mrs. Peacock is motivated by either ambition or betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Given that the only choice remaining to Mrs. Peacock is Betrayal and given that Mrs. Peacock's option was motivated by either greed, ambition, or betrayal, and given that the suspect motivated by Greed is Professor Plum and that the suspect motivated by Hatred is in the Kitchen (Mrs. Peacock), Mrs. Peacock must be the one motivated by Betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Since Mrs. Peacock is in the kitchen, the poison is at room 3 (Study), and given the poison must be in the Study, it is the murder room, it can't be the poison that Mrs. White used, which is the poison. As the poison in the study is used by Mrs. Peacock (Betrayer), then it follows that the study must be the room which has only one weapon, the Poison.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Mrs. Peacock must use the knife since the options are wrench, wrench and poison.\n",

Then, the Revolver was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM. The Rope was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM. The Knife was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM, but Mrs. White moved the Knife from the Conservatory to the Ballroom at 12:00 AM. Madame Rose was in the Conservatory at both 11:00 PM and 12:30 AM, so Madame Rose was in the Conservatory at 12:30 AM, since no one moved into the Conservatory at 12:30 AM. The Horseshoe was in the Drawing Room at 11:30 PM if and only if Madame Rose was in the Conservatory at 12:30 AM, so the Horseshoe was in the Drawing Room at 11:30 PM. The Rope was in the Hall at 10:30 PM. The murderer was in the Hall at 10:30 PM or the Rope was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, so the murderer must be in the Hall at 10:30 PM. But, the murderer was in the Hall at 11:30 PM if and only if the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, so the suspect motivated by Hatred must be in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM. Since the suspect motivated by Hatred moved from the Ballroom to the Conservatory at 11:00 PM and moved to the Drawing Room at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Hatred moved from the Ballroom to the Conservatory at 11:00 PM. Therefore, the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Ballroom at 11:00 PM. The murderer was in the Hall at 11:00 PM if and only if Mrs. White was in the Conservatory at 12:30 AM, so Mrs. White must be in the Conservatory at 12:30 AM.\n",

      "From the clues given, we know that Mr. Boddy was killed with the Revolver and since we do not know where the Revolver is, we will use the process of elimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the murder occurred in a room with the Revolver, but not in the Gazebo, the room with the Revolver must be the Carriage House.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also know that Mr. Boddy was in the Carriage House if and only if Professor Plum was in the Carriage House, so since Mr. Boddy was in the Carriage House, Professor Plum must be in the Carriage House as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that the Horseshoe was in the room just west of Monsieur Brunette, meaning that if the Horseshoe is in the Carriage House, Monsieur Brunette must be in the Gazebo.

      "However, we can't conclude that the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo from this alone, since the Gazebo could potentially have no one associated with it and we do not know where the Revolver is yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we have one more clue that we have not used yet. To select the Carriage House for the murder, it must have at least one weapon in it, and only the Revolver is in weapons that is associated with a specific room or associate. Since Mr. Boddy must be in the Carriage House if Professor Plum is there, and Prof Plum has an associate (the Revolver), and the Carriage House must have at least one weapon for the murder to happen, the Revolver is the weapon in the Carriage House. This means that Monsieur Brunette is in the Gazebo. Which makes the Horseshoe located in the Gazebo as well. \n",

      "E. Kitchen\n",
      "F. Room just south of the Poison.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Mr. Boddy was in the room just south of the Poison at 11:30 PM, and the Horseshoe was in the same room as the Poison at 11:30 PM, we can assume Mr. Boddy and the Horseshoe were in different rooms than the Poison at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Poison was in the room just north of Madame Rose at 11:30 PM, the Poison and the Horseshoe must be in rooms W1 and W2 respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Mr. Boddy was in the room just south of the Poison at 11:30 PM, Mr. Boddy must be in room S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the information that Madame Rose was in the room just south of Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM, Mr. Boddy and Madame Rose must have been in the same room at 12:00 AM. Also, since the murderer moved from the Kitchen to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM, Madame Rose (as the murderer) must have moved from the Kitchen to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the fact that Mr. Boddy was killed with the Poison, Mr. Boddy and Madame Rose must have been in the same room with the Poison at some point. Since the Poison was in the room just north of Madame Rose at 11:30 PM, and the Poison was in room W1 at 11:30 PM, Madame Rose must be in room W2 at 11:30 PM, and Mr. Boddy must be in room W1 at 11:30 PM, then the Poison must be in room W2 at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Madame Rose must have been in the room just north of the Poison (W2) at 12:00 AM. But since the Killer moved from the Kitchen to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM, Madame Rose cannot have been in the Kitchen, therefore she must be in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM (Was in the room just south of Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Madame Rose must have moved from the Gazebo to the Kitchen or W1 at 12:00 AM since the Killer moved from the Kitchen to the Gazebo. But we've already said Madame Rose must be in the Gazebo at 12:00 AM. However since Mr. Boddy was in the room just south of the Poison at 11:30 PM, Mr. Boddy must be in the kitchen at 11:30 PM. And since the Killer moved from the Kitchen to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM, Mr. Boddy is dead at 12:00 AM. Thus Madame Rose must have been in the kitchen to kill Mr. Boddy at 12:00 AM, and then moved to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM.\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "We can start by using the given information that the Lead Pipe was in the same room as the Poison at 12:00 AM. From the given room layout, we can figure out that the only possible rooms that can be adjacent to the Library (where the Lead Pipe was at 11:00 PM) and the Dining Room (since the murder must have occurred in the Dining Room, Billiard Room, or the Library) is the Billiard Room, the Drawing Room, or the Library. This means the Lead Pipe and the Poison were either in the Billiard Room or the Library at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we can use the information that the Lead Pipe was in the Library at 11:00 PM, which we can infer that it must be located in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM. Furthermore, this indicates that the Poison was also located in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we can start solving the rest of the clues. The Wrench was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 11:00 PM. This must be the Billiard Room since the only other suspect who could possibly be in the Library is Mr. Boddy. Thus, at 11:00 PM, the Billiard Room contained Mrs. Peacock, the Wrench, and Mr. Boddy. Hence, Madame Rose was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Lead Pipe was in the Library at 11:00 PM, so the Wrench must have moved there. Thus the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM could not have contained the Wrench or Mrs. Peacock. Using the information that the suspect motivated by Hatred and the Candlestick were in the Trophy Room together at least once, we can determine that the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Trophy Room at 11:00 PM since the Lead Pipe and the Poison were in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM and the Lead Pipe was in the Library at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the only rooms that the Wrench and the Lead Pipe can be in at 12:00 AM are the Library and the Billiard Room, but we've already shown that the Lead Pipe was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM.  So the Wrench must be in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM and therefore the suspect motivated by Hatred must have moved it to the Book room. But this would put the Wrench in the same room as the Lead Pipe at 12:00 AM. Thus the Library contains the Lead Pipe and the Wrench at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the information that the suspect motivated by Greed was in the room just east of Mr. Green at 12:00 AM, we can deduce that if the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Library then Mr. Green must have been in the studio since he is in the room just west of the Library Since we know that the Dining Room was the location of the murder, and it's possible that someone moved it there, but Mr. Green is motivated by Power, so Mr. Green cannot be the murderer, but one of the suspects in the Library must be the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the information that Mr. Boddy was in the Studio at 11:00 PM or the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM is irrelevant, so Mr. Boddy was not in the Studio at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, using the information that Madame Rose is motivated by Greed, we can deduce that she must be in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, which was already known.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the murderer must be one of the people in the Library at 12:00 AM, which contains the Lead Pipe and the Wrench.  But if the murderer was Mrs. White, the Lead Pipe must be the Knife, but we've already shown that the Lead Pipe was in the Library at 11:00 PM so the Lead Pipe cannot be the Knife. Hence Mrs. White cannot be in the Library at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the information that Madame Rose was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM if and only if the Wrench was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM and Madame Rose is in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, the Wrench was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, using the information that Sgt. Gray was in the room just east of Mr. Green at 11:00 PM, we can deduce that Sgt. Gray was in the Studio at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have the complete list of people who were at 11:00 PM in the studio, we can determine the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "The people who were in the Studio at 11:00 PM were Sgt. Gray, Mrs. White, and Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know from the information that the murderer was in the Dining Room at 11:00 PM or Sgt. Gray was in the Studio at 12:00 AM that Sgt. Gray was in the Studio at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the information that Sgt. Gray was in the Studio at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, and the suspect motivated by Anger was in the same room as the Candlestick, which was in the Trophy Room at 11:00 PM, we can deduce that Sgt. Gray, Mrs. Peacock, and Mr. Boddy were in the Studio at 11:00 PM, and Sgt. Gray, the suspect motivated by Anger, and Mr. Boddy were in the Studio at 11:00 PM. It means the suspect motivated by Hatred, who moved the Wrench to the Library, was in the Trophy Room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the information that Madame Rose was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM, we can deduce that Sgt. Gray was in the Studio at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the information that the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM contained the Wrench and Mrs. Peacock, the suspect motivated by Anger must have been in the Trophy Room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can use the information that the suspect motivated by Hatred moved from the room where the Lead Pipe is at 12:00 AM to the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM. We already know the Lead Pipe was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM and the Lead Pipe was in the Library at 11:00 PM. So, from the given room layout, it must be the Library. The suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Library at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the clue that the Lead Pipe was in the Library at 11:00 PM, and the Lead Pipe was in the same room as the Poison at 12:00 AM, we can determine that the Poison was in the Library at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the information that Mr. Boddy was killed by the Knife, the Killer must have had the knife at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the information that the suspect motivated by Power and the Revolver were not in the same room at 11:00 PM, we can determine that Sgt. Gray was not in the Dining Room at 11:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Library at 11:00 PM and the suspect motivated by Hatred moved from the Trophy Room to the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM. Hence, the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM. However, we've already determined that the Lead Pipe was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the suspect motivated by Hatred is actually in the Library at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only suspect that was in the Library at 12:00 AM is Mrs. White. So Mrs. White was in the Library at 11:00 PM. Using the information that Mrs. White was in the room just south of the Revolver at 11:00 PM, Mrs. White must be in the Drawing Room at 11:00 PM. We've already determined that the Revolver can't be in the room just north of the Studio since Sgt. Gray was in the Studio at 12:00 AM.\n",
