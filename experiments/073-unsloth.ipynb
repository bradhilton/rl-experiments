      "F. Greed\n",
      "G. Carriage House\n",
      "H. Gazebo\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "From the clues, we can start by narrowing down the suspect who moved the Lead Pipe from the Cloak Room to the Gazebo (at 11:00 PM) and then to the Drawing Room (at 12:00 AM). Since only Mr. Green was in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM, the Lead Pipe in the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM must have been moved by Mr. Green.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Ballroom at 10:00 PM. As the Lead Pipe was in the Ballroom at this time (or the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Ballroom if the Lead Pipe was in the Ballroom), the suspect motivated by Jealousy must have moved the Lead Pipe from the Gazebo to the Ballroom at 10:00 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Lead Pipe was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Jealousy must have stayed in the Ballroom from 10:00 PM to 12:00 AM. Then, the suspect moved the Lead Pipe to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM and it was moved again to the Gazebo at 01:00 AM. Thus, the Lead Pipe was in the Gazebo at 01:00 AM for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Candlestick was in the Studio at 11:30 PM, it must have been there all the time. The suspect motivated by Fear was in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM or the suspect motivated by Revenge was in the Carriage House at 01:00 AM. The suspect motivated by Greed moved from the Carriage House to the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM (previously established that the Greed and the Greed suspect \"played a game together\" at 10:30 PM) then to the room several spaces away from the Trophy Room (at 12:30 AM, given that the Greed suspect was not in the same room as the suspect motivated by Pride). \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the Greed suspect must be someone who could be in a hall at 12:30 AM (not Colonel Mustard as he was with Madame Rose). Therefore, the Greed suspect is Mrs. White. As the Greed suspect was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM and in the Hall at 12:30 AM, she was in the same room as the murderer at the estimated time. The Lead Pipe in the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM must have been moved by the Greed suspect. Since the Lead Pipe must have been moved at some point, the Greed suspect can be associated with this moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from the clues, the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Hall at 11:30 PM. The suspect motivated by Power moved from the Cloak Room to the Hall at 12:30 AM, so the suspect motivated by Jealousy must have moved from the Hall to the Ballroom at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, we can associate 2 suspects (Mrs. White and the suspect motivated by Jealousy) to the 2 clues (the Lead Pipe in the Gazebo and the Lead Pipe in the Drawing Room). If they hadn't stayed in their current rooms, the murder wouldn't happen. Since Mrs. White was in the Gazebo at 12:30 AM, she can't move to the Drawing Room at 12:00 AM. Since the murder wouldn't be able to happen in case the Greed and the Jealousy suspects stay, both of them must be in the same room at 12:30 AM. Since the Greed and the Jealousy suspects were in the Carriage House and Hall at the same time, each of them can only be in the rooms adjacent to the Carriage House and the Hall, thus they have to be in the same room at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Greed suspect must be Mrs. White (explained earlier). The Greed suspect was in the Hall at 12:30 AM. Since the murder must happen between the Greed and Jealousy suspects in the same room, the Hall is the only place the murder would occur.\n"

Mrs. Peacock can move to the 3rd room in the second column, which implies that the suspect motivated by Ambition is not Mr. Green. Mrs. Peacock can move to the 3rd room in the 2nd column or the 1st room in the 3rd column, implying that Mrs. Peacock cannot be the suspect motivated by Power. Mrs. Peacock can move to the 3rd room in the 1st column, implying that Mrs. Peacock is not the suspect motivated by Hatred. Hence, the killer must be Mrs. Peacock who is motivated by Ambition.\n",
      "3. The killer was in the same room as the Knife at some point in the night, (because Professor Plum was in the same room as the Knife at 12:00 AM), but the killer and the knife must not be in the same room at 11:30 PM, because the killer must not be in the first room in the 1st column at 11:30 PM (since Mrs. Peacock cannot be in the first column and the suspect motivated by Hatred cannot kill), and there is no place for the suspect motivated by Hatred to move. Hence, the killer was in the Hall.\n",
      "4. Since the killer was in the Hall at some point in the night, the killer must be in the Hall at 11:30 or 12:00 AM. At 11:30, the Hall is occupied by Mr. Boddy, so the killer must be in the Hall at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "5. Since the suspect motivated by Desire was in the Hall at 12:00 AM if and only if the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM, the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "6. Since one of the rooms in the 2nd column has a unique empty space, the suspect motivated by Jealousy must be one of Colonel Mustard, Miss Scarlet, Sgt. Gray, or Mrs. Peacock at 11:30 PM. Since the suspect motivated by Pride was in the same room as the Knife at 11:30 PM, and Professor Plum was in the Cloak Room at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Pride must be Professor Plum at 11:30 PM. Since Mr. Green was in the library at 11:30 PM, Professor Plum, who is in the Cloak Room at 11:30 PM, cannot be Sgt. Gray because Sgt. Gray was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM if and only if Madame Rose was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM, implying Sgt. Gray was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM. Since the suspect motivated by Pride was Professor Plum at 11:30 PM and the suspect motivated by Jealousy was in the same room as Miss Peach at 12:00 AM, Miss Peach must be either Colonel Mustard, Mr. Boddy, or Mrs. Peacock. Since Mr. Boddy was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM, Miss Peach cannot be Mr. Boddy, and since the Ballroom is not empty at 11:30, Mrs. Peacock cannot be Miss Peach either because the Hall is already occupied by the killer at 11:30 PM and 12:00 AM. Hence, Miss Peach must be Colonel Mustard at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "7. Since Monsieur Brunette was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM if and only if the Rope was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM, Monsieur Brunette was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM and the Rope was in the Ballroom at 12:00 AM. Since the carriages house is in the 3rd column, and at 11:30, the carriages house is occupied by Mr. Boddy, Mr. Boddy must have been in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM. Since Colonel Mustard was not in the Conservatory or the Lounge at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM because the Ballroom is occupied by Mr. Boddy and one of the rooms in the 2nd column has a unique empty space. Hence, Mrs. White was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "8. Since the suspect motivated by Betrayal was Mrs. White at 11:30 PM and the suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM if and only if Mrs. White was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, Mrs. White was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM. Since Professor Plum was in the Cloak Room at 11:30 PM, and the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM if and only if the Wrench was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "9. Since the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, and the suspects in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM were Mrs. White and the suspect motivated by Jealousy, the suspect motivated by Jealousy was Miss Peach (Colonel Mustard), and the suspect motivated by Fear was not the suspect motivated by Jealousy. However, at 11:30, the Wrench cannot be in the Lounge (because Sgt. Gray was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM if and only if Madame Rose was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM) and the suspect motivated by Fear was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, so the suspect motivated by Fear must be Mrs. Peacock.\n",
      "10. Since the suspect motivated by Fear was Mrs. Peacock at 11:30 PM, and the suspect motivated by Fear was in the same room as the Rope at 12:00 AM, the Rope was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "11. Since the Rope was in the same room with the suspect motivated by Fear at 12:00 AM, and the suspect motivated by Fear was the suspect motivated by Greed, the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "12. Since the suspect motivated by Greed was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM, and Mr. Boddy was in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM and 12:00 AM, and the Ballroom was occupied at 11:30, the suspect motivated by Greed was either the suspect motivated by Hatred, the suspect motivated by Pride, or Professor Plum was in the Conservatory. However, since the Ballroom was occupied by Mr. Boddy, the suspect motivated by Revenge cannot be in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM. Since the suspect motivated by Jealousy was Miss Peach, the suspect motivated by Hatred was neither the suspect motivated by Jealousy nor the suspect motivated by Greed because the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the same room as the suspect motivated by Jealousy. Hence, the suspect motivated by Hatred was either Professor Plum, Mrs. Peacock, or Sgt. Gray. However, since Sgt. Gray was in the lounge at 12:00 AM, Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 11:30 PM, and the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the same room as the suspect motivated by Jealousy, Sgt. Gray was not the suspect motivated by Hatred. Hence, the suspect motivated by Hatred and Professor Plum was in the Conservatory at 11:30 PM. Professor Plum was not in the guardhouse at 11:30 PM because at 11:30, Mr. Boddy was in the Ballroom and Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall, and Col. Mustard was in the bedroom so it is impossible for the suspect motivated by Hatred to kill Mr. Boddy at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "13. Since the suspect motivated by Pride was in the same room as the Knife at 11:30 PM, and Professor Plum was in the Cloak Room at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Pride was Professor Plum. However, since the suspect motivated by Hatred was in the same room as the suspect motivated by Jealousy, the suspect motivated by Hatred was neither the suspect motivated by Pride nor the suspect motivated by Jealousy. The suspect motivated by Hatred was either Colonel Mustard or Mrs. Peacock.\n",
      "14. Since the killer was in the Hall and the suspect motivated by Hatred was either Colonel Mustard or Mrs. Peacock, both Colonel Mustard and Mrs. Peacock must be in positions that block the movement of the killer at 11:30 PM. Hence, Colonel Mustard must be in the second room in the first column at 11:30 PM and Mrs. Peacock must be in the first room in the first column at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "15. Since Mrs. Peacock was in the first room of the first column at 11:30 PM, the carriages House was in the second room in the third column and Madame Rose was not in the kitchen at 11:30 PM because Mrs. Peacock was in the first room in the first column. Since Madame Rose was in the same room as Miss Peach and Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 12:00 AM, Mrs. Peacock and Madame Rose were in the same room at 11:30 PM. Madame Rose was in one of the rooms in the third column at 11:30 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the first room in the first column. Since Mrs. Peacock was not in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM because the killer was in the carriages house, Mrs. Peacock was in the last room in the 3rd column at 11:30 PM. Hence, Madame Rose must be in the first room in the 3rd column at 11:30 PM. Since the third room in the 3rd column has a unique empty space at 11:30, Monsieur Brunette must be either in the third room in the 2nd column or the third room in the first column at 11:30 PM. Since Monsieur Brunette was in the carriages house at 11:30 PM or the suspect motivated by Power was in the carriages house at 11:30 PM, Monsieur Brunette was in the carriages house at 11:30 PM. Hence, Mr. Boddy was either in the third room in the second column or the first room in the first column because 11:30 PM the carriages house has Monsieur Brunette and Madame Rose occupies one of the first two rooms in the first column. Since the carriages house was occupied at 11:30 PM and Colonel Mustard was in the second room in the first column at 11:30 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the first room in the first column at 11:30 PM, Mr. Boddy was in the first room in the first column at 11:30 PM and Mrs. Peacock was in the killer's room at 11:30 PM. \n",
      "16. Since Mrs. Peacock and the Rope were in the first room in the first column at 11:30 and 12:00 AM, and Mrs. Peacock was in the Hall at 12:00 AM, Mrs. Peacock moved from the first room in the first column at 11:30 PM to the Hall at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "17. Since the suspect motivated by Power was in the carriages house at 11:30 PM or the suspect motivated by Power was in the carriages house, Mr. Boddy must be in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Revenge must not be in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Ambition must not be in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Hatred must not be in the Ballroom at 11:30 PM, the suspect motivated by Hate was in the carriages house at 11:30 PM, and the killer was in the Hall at 12:00 AM and in the carriages house at 11:30 PM.

      "Response:\n",
      "Let's break down the information given to solve the puzzle.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the given information:\n",
      "- Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard (given)\n",
      "- The Lead Pipe was in the room just east of Mr. Boddy (given)\n",
      "- A suspect motivated by Power was in the same room as Mr. Boddy (given)\n",
      "- Mrs. White is motivated by Power (given)\n",
      "- Mrs. White was in the Hall (given)\n",
      "- The Wrench cannot be in the Hall if the murder was in the Courtyard (given)\n",
      "- The murder weapon was in the Courtyard if and only if the Wrench was in the Hall (given)\n",
      "- The Lead Pipe cannot be in the Courtyard because if the murder weapon was the Lead Pipe, the Wrench would need to be in the Hall, which means the murder occurred in the room that was east of the Lead Pipe, but we already know that the Lead Pipe is east of the Courtyard, so it would mean that the murder occurred in the Courtyard, which is a contradiction.\n",
      "Given this, the Lead Pipe must not be the murder weapon. The Lead Pipe must be in the room just east of the Courtyard.\n",
      "- The Lead Pipe is east of Mr. Boddy, so Mr. Boddy is either in the Courtyard or the room just east of the Courtyard, but we already know Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard, so the room just east of Mr. Boddy is the room just east of the Courtyard (which is the room with number 3).\n",
      "- The Knife was in the room just east of Miss Scarlet, which must be the room with number 3 as well (since Colonel Mustard was in the room just east of the Knife, which means the room just east of the Knife is the room with number 6), the room with number 3 must be to the left of the room with number 6.\n",
      "- The room to the west of the Knife (which is the room with number 6), must be the room with number 2.\n",
      "- The room to the east of the Knife (which is the room with number 3), must be the room with number 5.\n",
      "- Monsieur Brunette was in the room just west of the Knife (given), so Monsieur Brunette was in the room with number 2.\n",
      "- Since the room with number 2 is west of the room with number 3, Monsieur Brunette (in the room with number 2) cannot be to the east of the Lead Pipe, so Monsieur Brunette is not the suspect motivated by Power.\n",
      "- Since the Lead Pipe is in the room with number 3 and Mrs. White is in the Hall, Mrs. White cannot be in the room with number 3 and since the Power motive is tied to Mrs. White, Mrs. White cannot be motivated by Power.\n",
      "- If a Power motive is tied to someone that is in the same room as Mr. Boddy (who is in the Courtyard), then the Power motive must be tied to one of the people that are in the room with the Lead Pipe (which is the room with number 3).\n",
      "- A suspect that was in the room just east of the Courtyard cannot be in the same room as Mr. Boddy, so that room (with number 3) is either the room with the Knife or the room with the Wrench. However, since we know that Monsieur Brunette was in the room with number 2, the room with number 3 cannot be the room with the Knife because if the Knife was in the room with number 3, Monsieur Brunette would need to be in the room with the Wrench.\n",
      "- If Monsieur Brunette was in the room with the Wrench, then the Wrench is in the Courtyard, which contradicts the given information that the murder weapon was in the Courtyard if and only if the Wrench was in the Hall.\n",
      "- So the room with the Lead Pipe must be the room with the Knife, which means that the Knife is in the room with number 3.\n",
      "- Mr. Green must be in the room with number 1, because Mr. Boddy is in the room with number 2 or the room with number 3, and Mr. Boddy cannot be in the room with number 3 because he is to the west of the Lead Pipe, but if he was in the room with number 2, then Mr. Green would be in the room to the east of the Lead Pipe and the room with number 3 would be to the east of the room with number 2.\n",
      "- Since the Lead Pipe is in the room with the Knife, Mr. Green cannot be the Power motive suspect because if he were, then the Lead Pipe would be the murder weapon and we've already ruled that out.\n",
      "- Since the motive tied to someone in the room with Mr. Boddy cannot be Ambition (because Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard), it cannot be tied to Monsieur Brunette, and since it can't be tied to the suspect in the room with the Lead Pipe (which is the Lead Pipe's room), it cannot be tied to Mr. Green, the Power motive must be tied to the person in the room with number 2, which is Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "- Colonel Mustard, who is motivated by Power, was in the room just east of the Knife (given), so the room just east of the Knife was the room with number 6.\n",
      "- Since Colonel Mustard was in the room with number 6 and the room with number 6 is to the east of the room with number 3, the room just west of the Knife is the room with number 2.\n",
      "- Since Colonel Mustard was in the room with number 6, then it can't be in the Hall, and it can't be in the room with number 2 because it would be west of the Knife, so it must be in either the room with number 3 (Bad) or the room with number 5. However, since Colonel Mustard was in the room with number 6 and the Lead Pipe is in the room with number 3, Colonel Mustard could not be in the room with number 3 because the Lead Pipe is in the room just east of the Courtyard, so Colonel Mustard must be in the room with number 5.\n",
      "- Since the Lead Pipe is in the room with the Knife, and the Lead Pipe is in the room just east of the Courtyard, Mr. Boddy must be in the Courtyard and the room with the Lead Pipe must be the room with the number 3 (as previously stated).\n",
      "- The room with number 3 is the room just east of the Lead Pipe, and the Lead Pipe is in the room with number 3, so the room to the east of the Lead Pipe is the room with number 6.\n",
      "- The room just west of the Lead Pipe (which is the room with number 3) was Bloced by a contestant previously, this means the room with the Lead Pipe is the room just east of the Courtyard, so the Courtyard is the room with number 2, and the room with number 3 is just to the east of the Courtyard (which is incorrect because Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard), the correct order then is: the room with the number 1 to the north, Courtyard to the east, then a room to the east of the Courtyard, then the room with the number 3, then 4, then 5 then 6. \n",
      "- The room just east of the Lead Pipe is the room with number 6, and the room with number 6 is the room with the Knife, which means the Lead Pipe is not the murder weapon.\n",
      "- Colonel Mustard was in the room with the Knife, Colonel Mustard (in the room with the Knife) was in the room with the number 6, which is to the east of the Lead Pipe, so the Lead Pipe is in the room with number 3. Since the Lead Pipe is in the room with number 3, the room east of the Lead Pipe (which is the room with number 6) cannot be the Courtyard, it must be the room with the number 5 (because Mr. Boddy is in the Courtyard), and the room east of the Courtyard must be the room with the number 4, the room with the number 1 must be to the north of the room with the number 4, the room with the number 2 must be to the north of the room with the number 1, and the room with the number 3 must be to the east of the room with the number 2.\n",
      "- Given that Colonel Mustard was in the room with the Knife, and the room with the Knife is the room with number 6, which is to the east of the Lead Pipe, the Lead Pipe is in the room with the number 3, but it cannot be the murder weapon, so there are two possibilities: the Lead Pipe is in the room with the number 6, or the Lead Pipe is in the room with the number 4.\n",
      "- The Lead Pipe cannot be in the room with number 6, because that would mean Mr. Boddy is in the room with number 5 or the room with number 4 (since there is no room to the east of the Courtyard other than the room with number 3, the room with number 4 and the room with number 5), but Mr. Boddy is in the Courtyard, so the Lead Pipe must be in the room with the number 4, which means there are two rooms to the east of the Lead Pipe: the room with the number 5 and the room with the number 6.

      "\n",
      "To determine the answer to A, we start by analyzing the clues that involve Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significant clue about Colonel Mustard is \"Colonel Mustard was in the room just east of Mr. Green at 11:00 PM.\" Since the grid is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "  N N N  \n",
      "W 1|2|3 E\n",
      "W 4|5|6 E\n",
      "W 7|-|- E\n",
      "  S S S  \n",
      "\n",
      "The only possible rooms that are east of Room 2 are Room 3, Room 6, and Room 0 (which does not exist in this grid). This means that at 11:00 PM, at least one of the following must be true: (Mr. Green is in Room 1 and Colonel Mustard is in Room 3), (Mr. Green is in Room 2 and Colonel Mustard is in Room 6), or (Mr. Green is in Room 2 and Colonel Mustard is in a non-existent Room 0). Therefore, considering the options, (Mr. Green is in Room 2 and Colonel Mustard is in Room 6) is the only one that makes sense because all the other options lead to a contradiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another clue that relates to Colonel Mustard is \"A suspect motivated by Betrayal moved from the Trophy Room to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM.\" This indicates that Colonel Mustard could be the suspect motivated by Betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now looking at clue E, \"The murder could only have occured in one of the following rooms: 1. Study 2. Courtyard 3. Carriage House 4. Gazebo 5. Trophy Room 6. Kitchen 7. Lounge.\" \"The murder weapon was in the Carriage House at 11:00 PM\" means the murder must have occurred in the Carriage House, the Kitchen, the Lounge, the Study, or the Trophy Room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now looking at clue D, \"The Revolver was in the Lounge at 12:00 AM or Miss Peach was in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM.\" The Revolver cannot be in the Lounge at 12:00 AM if the murder was in the Lounge (this is because the murderer must have at least one of the weapons at some point before the murder, and the only possible time suggested that the Revolver could have been in the Lounge and one of the rooms that the murder could have been in is if it was in the Lounge at 11:30 PM, but that leads to a contradiction because the Revolver would have been in the Lounge and the Lounge is not the same room as the murder weapon Carriage House. Thus the murder must not be in the Lounge), so if the Revolver is not in the Lounge, then Miss Peach was in the Kitchen at 11:00 PM. As a result, the murder must have occurred in the Kitchen, the Lounge, the Carriage House, the Study, or the Trophy Room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining the results of the previous two paragraphs, the murder must have occurred in the Kitchen, the Lounge, the Carriage House, the Study, or the Trophy Room. From clue E, \"Mr. Boddy was in the room just south of the Poison at 12:00 AM\" and clue F, \"The Poison was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM if and only if the Lead Pipe was in the Study at 11:30 PM,\" we know the Poison was in the Carriage House at 11:30 PM. This places Mr. Boddy in Room 4 at 12:00 AM, and since the Carriage House must be the bathroom, it also places the murder in the Kitchen at 11:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we know the murder time and room, we can determine whether the murderer has a Betrayal motive (that is, the suspect that moved from the Trophy Room to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM). The only time when the suspect that moved from the Trophy Room to the Gazebo at 12:00 AM and was in the study is when Colonel Mustard was in the Study at 12:00 AM. Since Mr. Boddy was in the room just south of the lead pipe (which was in the Study at some point), it means he was not moved to the study at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the available information, the only time when there was a suspect with a Betrayal motive in the study is when the suspect was in the study at 12:00 AM. So the possible times and places that the murderer could be the suspect with the Betrayal motive are the study at 12:00 AM, and the study was not the murder location. Thus, no suspect with a Betrayal motive was involved in the murder. This leaves Colonel Mustard to be the murderer, because one of the motives for Colonel Mustard is Betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we can confirm whether we solved the murder, we need to check our results against the given information. Clue E, \"The suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Study at 12:00 AM,\" does not conflict with our results because the suspect with a Betrayal motive is not the one motivated by Ambition, and our suspect Colonel Mustard is not the suspect with a Betrayal motive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue C, \"Miss Peach and Mrs. White were in the Trophy Room together at least once,\" does not conflict with our results because at least one possible solution to this puzzle is that Miss Peach and Mrs. White visit the study, the Carriage House, the Kitchen, the Lounge, or the Study. At least one of these rooms is the possible murder location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue G, \"The Horseshoe was in the same room as the Revolver at 12:00 AM,\" does not conflict with our results because the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 11:00 PM, meaning at 12:00 AM Horseshoe that was in the same room as the Revolver was in the Lounge. Clue A, \"The suspect motivated by Greed was in the Trophy Room at 11:00 PM if and only if a suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Trophy Room at 11:30 PM,\" does not conflict with our results because the suspect with a Greed motive cannot be the suspect with a Betrayal motive. Clue E, \"A suspect motivated by Pride moved the Knife from the Carriage House to the Kitchen at 12:00 AM,\" does not conflict with our results because a suspect with a Pride motive does not move the Knife at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue F, \"Mrs. Peacock moved from the Kitchen to the Carriage House at 11:30 PM,\" and Clue H, \"Mr. Boddy was in the Trophy Room at 11:00 PM,\" do not conflict with our results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue H, \"The Lead Pipe was in the same room as the Wrench at 11:00 PM,\" does not conflict with our results.\n",
      "\n",
      "After checking against the available information, we can confirm that the murder was indeed committed by Colonel Mustard with the Lead Pipe in the Study at 11:30 PM, where the Poison was in the Carriage House.\n"
